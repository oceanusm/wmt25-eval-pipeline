He studied the lines etched on his face, each one a reminder of the years gone by. A hint of gray threaded his hair now, and for a moment, he felt the weight of change settling in. \nHe didn’t want to label it an identity crisis. Not yet at least. But as he splashed the cold sink water on his face, memories of his pro hockey career flooded his mind. The thrill of the game, the adrenaline of competition, the love of the fans. All forty years of his life had practically been dedicated to making it to the highest level. Now those days were behind him. \n\nIt had been a remarkable twenty-year pro career, one that most players could only dream of. He wore a gleaming championship ring, a testament to his hard work and dedication. Kyle truly couldn’t have asked for more. With his wife and son by his side through every triumph and challenge, he was ready to step into this new chapter and return the favor they had shown him.\nToday marked a significant milestone for the Barnes family; Ryan’s first day of school in their new town. After Kyle’s retirement, they had chosen to relocate to New Hampshire so Ryan could attend St. Cassian’s, the prestigious hockey prep school where Kyle had once played. \n\nIt was usually his wife, Nicole, who ensured that milestones like this were executed flawlessly. But with his career behind him and plenty of free time ahead, they decided it was time to switch roles. After dedicating fifteen years to raising their son, Nicole was finally ready to return to work full-time and pursue her passion for interior design, leaving Kyle to navigate this unfamiliar routine on his own. \nKyle knew he should be excited, yet uncertainty tugged at him. Taking a deep breath, he forced himself to focus. It was time for Nicole and Ryan to take the lead, with his unwavering support behind them. He was determined not to let them down. \n\n“Fresh start,” he whispered to himself. “You got this.” \nKyle followed the enticing aroma of fresh coffee to the kitchen. Nicole was in the final moments of her new morning routine, screwing the lid onto her to-go cup. When she caught sight of him out of the corner of her eye, she flashed him a quick, warm smile.\n“Morning, Mr. Mom,” she said, her voice bright with excitement.\n“Morning,” he chuckled, closing the distance between them and pressing a kiss to her lips. “Pretty sure morning coffee is my new responsibility.”\n“You get a freebie today, rookie.” Nicole slung her purse over her shoulder and gave Kyle an encouraging pat on the backside as she passed him. “Alright, I’m outta here. Ryan needs to be downstairs in five minutes, and you two need to be out the door in ten. And don’t forget to snap at least one picture of him in his new uniform. I want a smile, or it doesn’t count!”\n\n“I’ll make sure he gets to school on time. No promises about the smiling part, though.”\n“If he behaves for the picture, tell him we can hit the diner after practice.”\n“Deal.” Kyle nodded. “Go get ’em, babe.”\nNicole winked at him as she opened the door to the garage. “Love you. Keep me updated!”\nAnd just like that, she was gone. The sudden silence was almost unsettling, prompting Kyle to pour himself a cup of coffee to distract his restless thoughts.\n“Hey, Ry! You about ready?” Kyle called up the stairs.\nSilence followed, typical for a teenager. Kyle settled at the table for the time being, scrolling through his phone. A new text pinged, and he tapped on it.\n\n“Barnesy.” It was from his old teammate, Luc Benoit, now coaching St. Cassian’s hockey team. “Need a favor. Meet me at the rink soon?” \n“Already need my advice on day one, Benny?” Kyle shot a teasing text back.\n“Just trying to keep you busy, old man.” \nKyle smiled at the jab. Even after all these years, their relationship had remained as lively and playful as it was in their twenties.\n”Be there in fifteen. Bout to drop off Ry.” \n“Shit,” he muttered under his breath when he checked the time. “Ryan William!” he yelled up the stairs. “If we’re late on your first day, your mom is going to skin me, and then I’m gonna skin you! Let’s go!”\n\n“I’m coming!” \nKyle pushed back from the table and swiftly poured his coffee from his favorite mug into a to-go cup. A moment later, the sound of hurried footsteps echoed down the stairs behind him. He grabbed his keys from the counter and turned to face his son.\n“Got everything?” Kyle asked. He took in the sight in front of him; his heart swelling with pride and a touch of nostalgia seeing his old school colors on his boy. \n“Yeah,” Ryan replied, tucking his school polo into his khaki pants. He noticed the warm expression on his dad’s face. “What’s with the look?”\n\n“Royal blue and gold really suit you, Champ.”\nRyan smirked and rolled his eyes. “You’re getting so soft in your old age.” \n“Is that so?” \nWith a playful grin, Kyle reached out to pinch the crook of Ryan’s neck, a gesture that had always made his son laugh.\nRyan burst into genuine laughter, tucking his chin and batting at Kyle’s hand to dodge the attack. “Okay, okay!”\n“That’s what I thought. Come on, let’s get moving.”\nKyle smiled and gave Ryan’s backside a light swat, nudging him along. They stepped outside, where the morning sun cast a warm glow over their freshly painted house, a vivid reminder of their recent move back to New England.\n\nThe atmosphere in the car was charged with a blend of anticipation and anxiety. Kyle could sense Ryan’s nervous energy radiating beside him, and he couldn’t help but remember his own first day, driven by his dad to this very school. He understood, probably more than anyone, the mix of excitement and fear his son was feeling.\nAs they pulled into the school parking lot, Kyle exhaled, taking in the stunning, castle-like buildings. He remembered just how much he loved this campus, especially in the fall when the foliage was at its peak.\n“Ready, buddy?” Kyle asked, glancing over as Ryan fiddled with his backpack in the passenger seat.\n\n“Yeah, I think so,” Ryan replied, his voice steady despite the nervous flutter in his stomach. There was a determination in his eyes that reassured Kyle.\n“Hey, you’ll do great,” Kyle said, offering a comforting smile. “But before you head to class, Mom wants a quick picture.”\nRyan groaned, anticipating the familiar routine. “Do we have to—”\n“Ryan,” Kyle replied, his tone light but firm. “Less attitude, please. You know the drill.”\nThey stepped out of the car, and Kyle quickly snapped a picture he knew Nicole would cherish. It wasn’t Ryan’s most enthusiastic smile, but it was a smile nonetheless.\n\n“I’ll see you at practice, okay?” Kyle wrapped an arm around Ryan’s shoulders, pulling him close and pressing a kiss to his soft, blonde curls. “Have a great day. Love you.”\n“Love you too.”\nKyle stood for a moment, watching as Ryan disappeared through the arched doorway of the main building. As the door swung shut behind his son, Kyle took a deep breath, knowing this was just the beginning of a new journey for them both.\nAfter a lifetime of strict schedules, the idea of an open day felt both liberating and daunting. So when Luc’s text came through this morning, Kyle was genuinely relieved, and a little thrilled, to have somewhere to be.\n\nHe made his way across campus toward the Griffin Den, the school’s storied ice rink, coffee in hand. The crisp morning air and familiar surroundings stirred something deep in his chest.\nKyle pushed open the doors to the rink, and the familiar scent of ice, rubber, and old gear hit him instantly. For the first time that day, he felt like himself. He stood in the stillness, letting the silence wash over him as he gazed out at the freshly zambonied sheet of ice, smooth and untouched, like a blank page waiting to be written on. \nKyle glanced up at the banners hanging from the rafters, his eyes quickly finding the year he and Luc had won their championship. The sight pulled him back in time, memories flooding in all at once, sharp and vivid, like the ice was still beneath his skates.\n\nSuddenly, a voice cut through his thoughts. “The good ol’ days, eh, Barnesy?”\nKyle turned to see Luc emerging from his office, a grin on his face as he walked over.\nKyle resisted the urge to roll his eyes at that grin. It was annoying as hell that Luc still looked like he belonged on the cover of GQ , even after a grueling pro hockey career of his own.\n“Just what I needed, another reminder that I’m getting old,” Kyle said with a chuckle. “It’s surreal being back. Seeing all this again…it feels like a lifetime ago.”\n“You’ll get used to it,” Luc said with a smile, reaching out for a firm handshake and pulling Kyle into a quick shoulder-clap hug, the kind of greeting that hadn’t changed since they were teammates.\n\nKyle noticed the file in Luc's hand, its edges worn from use. “What’s this? Got a scouting report for me?” he asked, curiosity piqued as he leaned in slightly, eager to hear what Luc had to share.\n“This,” Luc hummed as he tapped the file with his free hand, “is the favor. I’ll fill you in on the details. Come on, let’s sit.”\nKyle looked momentarily puzzled but settled onto the cold metal bleachers beside him.\n”So, we’ve got a last-minute addition, and usually we don’t make exceptions, right? Once the roster is finalized over the summer, that’s typically it,” Luc began. “But this kid is something special. I’m telling you, man, he’s got insane potential.”\n\nLuc handed the file to Kyle, who opened it with interest. \"Declan Avery Hull\" was printed in bold letters across the top, accompanied by a photo paperclipped to the top right corner. Kyle mentally noted the boyish features: deep green eyes, shiny, long, floppy brunette hair, and a bold expression that suggested confidence. His gaze then shifted to the hockey resume, and he raised his eyebrows at its impressive details.\nKyle let out a low whistle, the sound escaping him like a mix of surprise and admiration. “Damn, this kid is going to be a stud.”\n“Just wait until you see him play, he arrives tomorrow,” Luc said, his tone shifting slightly. “But I do have some concerns.”\n\n“With what?” Kyle asked, unable to find anything amiss in the details his eyes were scanning on the page.\nLuc flipped to the back, where the more personal information was stored, and pointed to the notes section with his finger.\nKyle read the first bullet point: “Off-ice behavior must be addressed if he wants to reach his full potential.”\nHis eyebrows instinctively raised at that, a knowing look passing between them as he turned to Luc. “Sounds like he’s a bit of a wildcard, huh?”\nLuc sighed, shaking his head as he fell deep into thought. “I don’t want to make excuses for him. Hell, I don’t even know him yet. But the kid has been bouncing from boarding school to boarding school for most of his childhood. That can’t be helping, right? I think what he really needs is stability.”\n\n“Where are the parents?” Kyle asked, the question feeling all too obvious given his own experiences. \nHe and Nicole had made it a priority to effectively manage their son’s off-ice behavior throughout his upbringing, committed to ensuring no negative bullet points marred his hockey resume. Any acting out was always nipped in the bud, immediately.\n“Mom’s not in the picture; hasn’t been since he was a baby, from what I hear,” Luc replied. “And the dad isn’t very present; he doesn’t show up to any games. Just writes the checks when he needs to.”\n“Shit,” was all Kyle could manage in response.\n\n“Yeah,” Luc sighed, shaking his head in frustration. “I just don’t feel right being just another boarding school for him, you know? He needs something more, something different. He needs a hockey family .”\nKyle couldn’t agree more; he felt a deep empathy for the kid. Having experienced the support of a tight-knit hockey family throughout his own career, he understood how crucial that foundation was.\n“How can I help, Benny?” he asked, his tone sincere.\n“I thought about taking the kid in, but I know he won’t want to live with the coach,” Luc began. “I realize this is a big ask, and I won’t be offended if you say no-“\n\nKyle cut in, finishing Luc’s thought. “You want us to be his billet family.”\nLuc nodded thoughtfully. “I’ve seen firsthand how you and Nicole raised Ryan, and just look at how incredible he turned out. If Declan has a support system like yours, it could be a game changer for him.”\nKyle took a moment to ponder. This wasn’t merely a simple favor; this was a responsibility for another soul. He hadn’t anticipated considering taking in a kid when he read Luc’s text that morning. Still, he would do anything for Luc, and the earnest look in his eyes made it clear just how serious this was to him. That meant it was now serious to Kyle as well.\n\n“I hear you, and I appreciate that you think so highly of me,” Kyle said, a teasing smile playing on his lips. “Let me chat with Nicole and Ryan over dinner tonight, and I’ll get back to you, okay? I’m confident we can work something out.”\n“I really appreciate it, man,” Luc said earnestly. “As a thank you for even considering it, feel free to use the gym here whenever you want. We don’t want you developing a dad bod, now do we?” he teased, giving Kyle’s stomach a playful pat. \n“Don’t you dare start that with me, you little sh—” Kyle retorted, unable to suppress a grin.\n\n“Got a meeting to run to!” Luc exclaimed, rising from the bleachers and jogging toward the coaches office before Kyle could finish his thought. “Keep that file tonight, just bring it back tomorrow. Love you!”\n“Yeah, yeah,” Kyle said, rolling his eyes with a chuckle.\nA mix of emotions stirred within Kyle as he found himself alone in the rink once more. The weight of the decision ahead loomed large, but he felt a flicker of hope. If there was a chance to make a difference for Declan, perhaps it was worth taking the leap.\nHe took a deep breath, glancing around the rink where memories flooded back once again: laughter, camaraderie, and the family he cherished. This new chapter was unfolding, a fresh purpose, and maybe it was finally time to embrace the unknown.\n\n“Okay, we’ve got two classic burgers, one club sandwich, and fries all around,” the waitress announced cheerfully as she placed each plate on the table with practiced ease. “Can I get you anything else?”\n“I think we’re all set, thanks, Jo,” Kyle said with a warm smile as he shifted his napkin onto his lap.\nThe Barnes family began digging in after the waitress left them to it. Ryan immediately reached for the ketchup and, true to form, drowned his fries in an absurd amount, completely unfazed by the amused glances from his parents.\nWithout a word, Kyle plucked the pickles from his burger and placed them on Ryan’s plate; a quiet ritual that had long become second nature. It was a small thing, but moments like that made Kyle feel grounded, like some parts of life hadn’t changed at all.\n\nThe table fell into a comfortable silence as everyone tucked into their meals, the clinking of silverware and the occasional satisfied hum filling the space between them. After a few minutes of quiet eating, Kyle leaned back slightly and broke the silence, ready to reconnect with his family.\n“Alright,” he hummed, taking a sip of his drink before setting the glass down. “Big day for all of us, huh? Who’s up first, anyone want to share?”\n”Oh, I’ll go,” Nicole said, her eyes lighting up. “As much as I love you, my beautiful boys, it was so nice to be back at the office today. Everyone was incredibly welcoming. Today was mostly administrative stuff, but we also talked through some upcoming projects, and I’m already itching to dive in.”\n\nKyle smiled, genuinely happy to see her so energized. “That’s awesome, babe. You’ve been waiting a long time for this.”\n“Yeah,” Ryan added between bites. “Mom’s finally getting to make other people’s houses look as cool as ours.”\n“Exactly!” Nicole cooed, giving Ryan’s bicep a soft pinch. “Though I do still expect your help moving samples around the garage, Mr. Muscles.”\nRyan groaned with a grin. “Knew that was coming.”\nKyle chuckled at their banter, then shifted in his seat, draping his arm around the back of Ryan’s chair so he could fully face him. As he moved, he gave the back of Ryan’s head a gentle scruff, earning a mock-annoyed eye roll from his son.\n\n“Alright, your turn, Champ. First day at St. Cassian’s, how’d it go?”\nRyan shrugged, poking at a fry. “It was alright.”\n“Just alright?” Nicole asked, raising an eyebrow. \n“I mean, it’s school. But the campus is pretty sick, and a couple of the guys on the team seemed cool. Classes weren’t bad either.”\nKyle nodded, his gaze steady. “That’s a solid start.”\nRyan gave another shrug, but this time it came with a small smile. “Yeah, I guess it wasn’t the worst first day.”\nKyle began rubbing a slow circle between Ryan’s shoulder blades absentmindedly, his gaze drifting to the window beside them. The sun was beginning to dip below the trees, casting golden streaks across the diner’s parking lot, a reminder of how quickly time was already passing.\n\n“Hey,” Kyle hummed, giving Ryan’s shoulder a light squeeze to catch his attention. “Tell your mom about practice. She’s been waiting all day to hear about it.”\nRyan perked up, his eyes brightening a little. “The rink’s insane, it’s like NHL-level. Uncle Luc- I mean, Coach Luc had us doing some light drills, mostly puck work and conditioning,” he said, trying to keep his voice even, though the excitement peeked through. \n“Yeah?” Nicole leaned in, genuinely curious. “Did it feel like the right fit?”\nRyan nodded. “Yeah. Everyone’s really good, but I think I held my own. Coach Luc kept it pretty easy on us for the first day, but I know it’s gonna ramp up fast.”\n\n“I’m so glad to hear that, baby,” Nicole said, reaching across the table to touch Ryan’s arm. Her fingers shifted, and she gave his chin a light tap with her knuckle. “Even if that smile in the picture your dad took this morning was, like, 40% effort at best.”\n“I smiled, didn’t I?” Ryan laughed, ducking his head. \n“Technically,” she teased, leaning back with a grin. “I have half a mind to make you retake it tomorrow.”\n“Nope,” Ryan said quickly, already shaking his head. “One per semester. That’s the rule.”\nKyle chuckled into his drink. “He’s been keeping track, apparently.”\n\nKyle watched the exchange with a quiet sense of contentment, the easy rhythm between Nicole and Ryan filling him with a familiar warmth. Then his gaze dropped to his plate, the weight of the earlier conversation with Luc nudging at the back of his mind. The time had come to shift gears.\nHe gave Nicole a small smile, then cleared his throat gently.\n“So, while we’re all sharing big firsts today,” Kyle began, his voice casual but deliberate, “there’s one more thing I wanted to run by you guys.”\nNicole looked up from her plate, brows knitting slightly with curiosity. “Everything okay?”\n\n“Yeah, yeah,” Kyle said quickly, waving a hand to ease the concern. “It’s nothing bad. Just…something Luc brought up this morning when I saw him at the rink.”\nRyan glanced up from his fries, picking up on the subtle shift in his dad’s tone. His posture straightened slightly, curiosity taking hold.\n“He asked me for a favor,” Kyle continued, glancing between them. “And it’s kind of a big one.”\nRyan raised an eyebrow, still chewing a fry. “Like, helping him move a couch kind of favor, or helping bury a body kind of favor?”\nNicole shot Ryan a disapproving look, but Kyle couldn’t help but chuckle. “It’s somewhere in between, I think.”\n\nRyan leaned back in his chair, taking a sip of his drink. “Okay, well now I’m really curious. What is it?” \nKyle shifted in his seat, removing his arm from the back of Ryan's chair and leaning forward slightly, resting his forearms on the table. “Luc asked if we’d consider being a billet family this season, for a new player joining the team.”\nNicole paused, setting down her glass with a thoughtful clink. “He wants us to take in a kid?” Her expression morphed, less surprise and more intrigue. “That’s definitely not something Luc would ask lightly.”\nKyle nodded. “Exactly. This kid, Declan Hull, he’s talented, no question. But his home life’s rocky. Luc thinks living with a stable family could really ground him.”\n\nRyan glanced between his parents, concern creeping into his expression. “Wait…does that mean he’d be, like, living with me? Am I going to have to share my room?” \nKyle met his eyes, offering a calm look to ease the concern. “He’ll be in the guest room, don’t worry. And honestly, part of why Luc thought of us is because he said you’d be a great example for him.”\nRyan leaned forward, mirroring his dad’s posture with his forearms on the table, his brows knitting together in thought. “Why wasn’t he at practice today then? If he’s on the team, shouldn’t he have started with the rest of us?”\n\nKyle nodded, understanding the question. He knew how important it was for a team to start the season together; same drills, same ice, building that early chemistry. \n“Luc said things came together really last minute, the paperwork just cleared. Declan gets in tomorrow, but he’s already locked in on the roster.”\nRyan tilted his head, clearly still processing. “Huh…that’s kind of wild. Just showing up outta nowhere.”\nKyle gently bumped his shoulder into Ryan’s, his voice steady. “Life isn’t always neat, Ry. This kid’s been bounced around for years, not because he’s a bad kid, but because no one’s given him a real chance. This might be his shot at something solid. So let’s not judge him before we even meet him, okay?”\n\nRyan pouted slightly at the soft scolding, his shoulders sinking just a bit. He looked down at his plate, quiet for a moment as he pushed a fry through the last streak of ketchup. \n“So he’s my age?” he asked, his voice more thoughtful now.\nKyle nodded. “Same grade. He’ll turn fifteen in May,” he said, watching Ryan closely for a reaction.\nBut nothing came. Ryan simply continued to eat the last of his fries, prompting Kyle to press on. “You okay with that?” he asked gently. “It’s a big shift, I know.”\nRyan shrugged, then nodded slowly. “I mean…yeah. I get it. If he really needs it, I’m not gonna be a jerk about it. Just gotta wrap my head around having a roommate now, I guess.”\n\nBefore Kyle could respond, Nicole quickly interjected. “If you weren’t okay with it, that wouldn’t make you a jerk, sweetheart. Do you understand? It’s natural to feel unsure, and you have the biggest heart I’ve ever seen, even when you try to hide it.”\nRyan gave a half-smile, eyes flicking toward his plate again.\nNicole glanced at Kyle, then back to Ryan. “And if this boy really needs a place to land, I think we’d be the right kind of home for him. It won’t be perfect, and it’ll probably take some adjusting, but we’ve got more to give. We always have.”\n\nShe looked at Kyle now, and his heart swelled. He reached for Nicole’s hand under the table and gave it a gentle squeeze.\n”I think it’s worth a shot, yeah?” Kyle nodded, his voice steady as he looked between the two of them. “But just so there’s no confusion, family comes first. It always has, and it always will.”\nNicole gave a small, knowing smile, and Ryan met his dad’s eyes, listening closely.\n“We’ll do our best to make this work,” Kyle continued, “but if it doesn’t feel right, if it’s too much or causes strain in the house, then we reassess. No guilt. No pressure. Just honesty.”\n\nHe paused for a beat. “But something tells me we might be exactly what this kid needs.”\nNicole reached for her water and nodded. “And maybe he’s exactly what we need too.”\nRyan leaned back in his seat, nudging his empty plate aside. “So…does finding out I’ve got a roommate now at least get me a to-go milkshake or something?”\nNicole raised an eyebrow, clearly amused. “Oh, we’re negotiating now?”\n“I mean, emotional growth is exhausting,” Ryan said with a grin. “I think I’ve earned some sugar.”\nKyle laughed, reaching for the check. “Fair enough. One chocolate milkshake, extra whipped cream. You definitely earned it.”\n\nAs they stood and gathered their things, the air around them felt lighter. They stepped out of the diner as one, Kyle’s arm draped protectively over Ryan’s shoulders, his other hand gently clasping Nicole’s.\nThere was still a lot unknown about what lay ahead, but they were facing it together.\nAnd that, Kyle thought, was more than a good start.\nThe house was quiet again. The kind of quiet that settles in only after a full day. Kyle padded barefoot down the hallway, coffee mug in one hand, Declan’s file tucked under his arm.\nThe bedroom light cast a warm glow across the sheets as Nicole emerged from the bathroom, brushing out the last bit of moisture from her hair. She wore one of Kyle’s old team t-shirts, the fabric soft and oversized, sleeves brushing her elbows.\n\nKyle was already propped up against the headboard when she climbed into bed beside him, pulling the covers over her lap with a contented sigh.\n“Ry asleep?” Nicole murmured, easing into his side, her fingers brushing lightly against his arm.\n“Mhm,” Kyle hummed, setting his mug down on the nightstand with a soft clink. The folder remained open on his lap, Declan’s profile page catching the soft pool of lamplight. Nicole’s gaze drifted to it.\n“You’ve read that three times already,” she said softly.\n“Yeah,” Kyle admitted, eyes still on the page. “I keep thinking about how young he looks. He’s just a kid. But there’s something in his eyes…I don’t know. It’s like he’s already carrying the weight of someone twice his age.”\n\nNicole leaned her head against his shoulder, her hand finding his on the file and resting there. “You’re already in it, huh?”\nKyle let out a breath through his nose; half a laugh, half a sigh. “I don’t know. Maybe. I just…I keep picturing what it would’ve been like for me at his age without my dad showing up to every game. Without someone giving a damn.”\nNicole was quiet for a moment, her thumb gently tracing his knuckles.\n“We’re good at giving a damn,” she said finally, her voice barely above a whisper.\nKyle turned to look at her, his expression soft. “You sure you’re up for this? Things were just starting to feel…balanced.”\n\n“I’m sure,” she said, meeting his eyes. “We’ve always made room when it mattered. This matters.”\n“And Ryan?” Kyle’s voice dipped, laced with quiet guilt. “I promised him this next chapter would be about him. More time together, just the two of us; his hockey, his moment. And now, day one, I’m asking him to share all of that with a complete stranger.”\n“What if it’s good for him too?” Nicole asked gently, her voice thoughtful. “Learning how to make space for someone else. Figuring out who he is not just on the ice, but as a teammate, a friend. Maybe even a brother.”\n\nKyle hadn’t considered that angle, not really. The idea settled over him slowly, unexpected but not unwelcome, like a shift in light that made the whole picture look different.\n“Damn,” Kyle murmured, a quiet smile tugging at his lips. “You’re good.”\nNicole grinned, tilting her head as she bumped her shoulder against his. “That’s why you married me, Barnes.”\n“Among a million other reasons,” he said, leaning over to press a kiss to her temple. “I love you.”\nShe smirked sleepily. “I love you too. Now turn off that light. We’ve got another big day tomorrow.” \nKyle chuckled, snapping the folder shut. He placed it gently on the nightstand beside his mug, then clicked off the lamp.\n\nAs darkness settled around them, he lay back beside her, one arm beneath her shoulders, the steady rhythm of her breathing already beginning to slow.\nAnd for a long while, Kyle stared at the ceiling, wide awake.\nTomorrow, everything would begin again. New roles. New routines. A new kid.\nA new chance.", "video": null, "screenshot": null, "prompt_instruction": "You are a professional English-to-Maasai translator, tasked with providing translations suitable for use in Kenya (mas_KE).

Meaku promises about the smiling part, though.” \n“If he neaku behave for the picture, tell enye we naidimuno hit the diner after practice.” \n“Deal.” Kyle neaku nod. “Go get ’em, babe.” \nNicole neaku wink at enye kama neaku open the door to the garage. “Love you. Keep me updated!” \nNa just kama that, neaku be gone. The sudden silence neaku almost unsettling, neaku prompt Kyle pee pour himself a cup o coffee pee distract restless thoughts enye. \n“Hey, Ry! You about ready?” Kyle neaku call up the stairs. \nSilence neaku follow, typical for a teenager. Kyle neaku settle at the table for the time being, neaku scroll through phone enye. A new text neaku ping, na neaku tap on it. \n\n“Barnesy.” It neaku from old teammate enye, Luc Benoit, now neaku coach St. Cassian’s hockey team. “Need a favor. Meet me at the rink soon?” \n“Already need advice enyena on day one, Benny?” Kyle neaku shoot a teasing text back. \n“Just neaku try pee keep you busy, old man.” \nKyle neaku smile at the jab. Even after all these years, relationship enye neaku remain kama lively na playful kama it neaku be e twenties enye. \n”Be there e fifteen. Bout to drop off Ry.” \n“Shit,” neaku mutter under breath enye when neaku check the time. “Ryan William!” neaku yell up the stairs. “If we neaku late on first day enyena, mom enyena neaku go pee skin me, na then naaku go pee skin you! Let’s go!” \n\n“Naaku come!” \nKyle neaku push back from the table na neaku swiftly pour coffee enye from favorite mug enye into a to-go cup. A moment later, the sound o hurried footsteps neaku echo down the stairs behind enye. Neaku grab keys enye from the counter na neaku turn to face olaiserr enye. \n“Got everything?” Kyle neaku ask. Neaku take e the sight e front o enye; heart enye neaku swell na pride na a touch o nostalgia neaku see old school colors enye on boy enye. \n“Yeah,” Ryan neaku reply, neaku tuck school polo enye into khaki pants. Neaku notice the warm expression e face enye o dad enye. “What’s na the look?” \n\n“Royal blue na gold really neaku suit you, Champ.” \nRyan neaku smirk na neaku roll eyes enye. “You neaku get so soft e old age enyena.” \n“Is that so?” \nNa a playful grin, Kyle neaku reach out pee pinch the crook o neck enye o Ryan, a gesture neaku always make olaiserr enye laugh. \nRyan neaku burst into genuine laughter, neaku tuck chin enye na neaku bat at hand enye o Kyle pee dodge the attack. “Okay, okay!” \n“That’s what naaku think. Come on, let’s neaku get moving.” \nKyle neaku smile na neaku give backside enye o Ryan a light swat, neaku nudge enye along. Neaku step outside, kai the morning sun neaku cast a warm glow over freshly painted house enye, a vivid reminder o recent move enye back to New England. \n\nThe atmosphere e the car neaku charge na a blend o anticipation na anxiety. Kyle naidimuno sense nervous energy enye o Ryan neaku radiate beside enye, na neaku meaku help ake neaku remember own first day enye, neaku drive by dad enye to this very school. Neaku understand, probably more than any nani, the mix o excitement na fear olaiserr enye neaku feel. \nKama neaku pull into the school parking lot, Kyle neaku exhale, neaku take e the stunning, castle-like buildings. Neaku remember just how much neaku love this campus, especially e the fall when the foliage neaku at its peak. \n“Ready, buddy?” Kyle neaku ask, neaku glance over kama Ryan neaku fiddle na backpack enye e the passenger seat. \n\n“Yeah, naaku think so,” Ryan neaku reply, voice enye steady despite the nervous flutter e stomach enye. There neaku a determination e eyes enye neaku reassure Kyle. \n“Hey, you neaku do great,” Kyle neaku say, neaku offer a comforting smile. “Ake before you neaku head to class, Mom neaku want a quick picture.” \nRyan neaku groan, neaku anticipate the familiar routine. “Do we neaku have to—” \n“Ryan,” Kyle neaku reply, tone enye light ake firm. “Less attitude, please. You neaku know the drill.” \nNeaku step out o the car, na Kyle neaku quickly snap a picture neaku know Nicole neaku cherish. It meaku Ryan’s most enthusiastic smile, ake it neaku a smile nonetheless. \n\n“Naaku see you at practice, okay?” Kyle neaku wrap an arm around shoulders enye o Ryan, neaku pull enye close na neaku press a kiss to soft, blonde curls enye. “Have a great day. Love you.” \n“Love you too.” \nKyle neaku stand for a moment, neaku watch kama Ryan neaku disappear through the arched doorway o the main building. Kama the door neaku swing shut behind olaiserr enye, Kyle neaku take a deep breath, neaku know this neaku just the beginning o a new journey for iltung’anak both. \nAfter a lifetime o strict schedules, the idea o an open day neaku feel both liberating na daunting. So when text enye o Luc neaku come through this morning, Kyle neaku genuinely relieved, na a little thrilled, pee have somewhere pee be. \n\nNeaku make way enye across campus toward the Griffin Den, the school’s storied ice rink, neaku hold coffee e hand. The crisp morning air na familiar surroundings neaku stir something deep e chest enye. \nKyle neaku push open the doors to the rink, na the familiar scent o ice, rubber, na old gear neaku hit enye instantly. For the first time that day, neaku feel kama himself. Neaku stand e the stillness, neaku let the silence wash over enye kama neaku gaze out at the freshly zambonied sheet o ice, smooth na untouched, kama a blank page neaku wait pee be written on. \nKyle neaku glance up at the banners neaku hang from the rafters, eyes enye neaku quickly find the year neaku na Luc neaku win championship enye. The sight neaku pull enye back e time, memories neaku flood e all at once, sharp na vivid, kama the ice neaku still beneath skates enye. \n\nSuddenly, a voice neaku cut through thoughts enye. “The good ol’ days, eh, Barnesy?” \nKyle neaku turn pee see Luc neaku emerge from office enye, a grin e face enye kama neaku walk over. \nKyle neaku resist the urge pee roll eyes enye at that grin. It neaku annoying kama hell that Luc neaku still look kama neaku belong e the cover o GQ, even after a grueling pro hockey career o own enye. \n“Just what naaku need, another reminder that naaku get old,” Kyle neaku say na a chuckle. “It’s surreal neaku be back. Neaku see all this again…it neaku feel kama a lifetime ago.” \n“You neaku get used to it,” Luc neaku say na a smile, neaku reach out for a firm handshake na neaku pull Kyle into a quick shoulder-clap hug, the kind o greeting neaku meaku change since neaku be teammates. \n\nKyle neaku notice the file e hand enye o Luc, edges enye neaku worn from use. “What’s this? Got a scouting report for me?” neaku ask, curiosity neaku pique kama neaku lean e slightly, eager pee hear what Luc neaku have pee share. \n“This,” Luc neaku hum kama neaku tap the file na free hand enye, “neaku the favor. Naaku fill you e the details. Come on, let’s neaku sit.” \nKyle neaku look momentarily puzzled ake neaku settle onto the cold metal bleachers beside enye. \n“So, we neaku got a last-minute addition, na usually we meaku make exceptions, right? Once the roster neaku finalize over the summer, that’s typically it,” Luc neaku begin. “Ake this kid neaku something special. Naaku tell you, man, neaku got insane potential.” \n\nLuc neaku hand the file to Kyle, neaku open it na interest. \"Declan Avery Hull\" neaku print e bold letters across the top, neaku accompany by a photo neaku paperclip to the top right corner. Kyle neaku mentally note the boyish features: deep green eyes, shiny, long, floppy brunette hair, na a bold expression neaku suggest confidence. Gaze enye neaku then shift to the hockey resume, na neaku raise eyebrows at details enye neaku impress. \nKyle neaku let out a low whistle, the sound neaku escape enye kama a mix o surprise na admiration. “Damn, this kid neaku go pee be a stud.” \n“Just wait until you neaku see enye play, neaku arrive tomorrow,” Luc neaku say, tone enye neaku shift slightly. “Ake naaku do have some concerns.” \n\n“With what?” Kyle neaku ask, naidimuno meaku find anything amiss e the details eyes enye neaku scan e the page. \nLuc neaku flip to the back, kai the more personal information neaku store, na neaku point to the notes section na finger enye. \nKyle neaku read the first bullet point: “Off-ice behavior must neaku address if neaku want pee reach full potential enye.” \nEyebrows enye neaku instinctively raise at that, a knowing look neaku pass between iltung’anak kama neaku turn to Luc. “Sounds kama neaku a bit o a wildcard, huh?” \nLuc neaku sigh, neaku shake head enye kama neaku fall deep into thought. “Naaku meaku want pee make excuses for enye. Hell, naaku meaku even know enye yet. Ake the kid neaku be bounce from boarding school to boarding school for most o childhood enye. That naidimuno meaku help, right? Naaku think what neaku really need neaku stability.” \n\n“Where neaku the parents?” Kyle neaku ask, the question neaku feel all too obvious given experiences enye own. \nNeaku na Nicole neaku make it a priority pee effectively manage off-ice behavior enye o olaiserr enye throughout upbringing enye, neaku commit pee ensure meaku negative bullet points neaku mar hockey resume enye. Any acting out neaku always nip e the bud, immediately. \n“Mom meaku e the picture; meaku be since neaku a baby, from what naaku hear,” Luc neaku reply. “Na the dad meaku very present; meaku show up to any games. Just neaku write the checks when neaku need to.” \n“Shit,” neaku all Kyle naidimuno manage e response. \n\n“Yeah,” Luc neaku sigh, neaku shake head enye e frustration. “Naaku just meaku feel right neaku be just another boarding school for enye, you neaku know? Neaku need something more, something different. Neaku need a hockey family.” \nKyle naidimuno meaku agree more; neaku feel a deep empathy for the kid. Neaku have experience the support o a tight-knit hockey family throughout career enye own, neaku understand how crucial that foundation neaku. \n“How naidimuno naaku help, Benny?” neaku ask, tone enye sincere. \n“Naaku think about neaku take the kid e, ake naaku know neaku meaku want pee live na the coach,” Luc neaku begin. “Naaku realize this neaku a big ask, na naaku meaku be offend if you neaku say no-“ \n\nKyle neaku cut e, neaku finish thought enye o Luc. “You neaku want us pee be billet family enye.” \nLuc neaku nod thoughtfully. “Naaku see firsthand how you na Nicole neaku raise Ryan, na just neaku look at how incredible neaku turn out. If Declan neaku have a support system kama yours, it naidimuno be a game changer for enye.” \nKyle neaku take a moment pee ponder. This meaku merely a simple favor; this neaku a responsibility for another soul. Neaku meaku anticipate neaku consider neaku take e a kid when neaku read text enye o Luc that morning. Still, neaku would do anything for Luc, na the earnest look e eyes enye neaku make it clear just how serious this neaku to enye. That neaku mean it neaku now serious to Kyle kama well. \n\n“Naaku hear you, na naaku appreciate that you neaku think so highly o us,” Kyle neaku say, a teasing smile neaku play e lips enye. “Let me neaku chat na Nicole na Ryan over dinner tonight, na naaku get back to you, okay? Naaku confident we naidimuno work something out.” \n“Naaku really appreciate it, man,” Luc neaku say earnestly. “Kama a thank you for even neaku consider it, neaku feel free pee use the gym here whenever you neaku want. We meaku want you neaku develop a dad bod, now do we?” neaku tease, neaku give stomach enye o Kyle a playful pat. \n“Meaku you dare start that na me, you little sh—” Kyle neaku retort, naidimuno meaku suppress a grin. \n\n“Got a meeting pee run to!” Luc neaku exclaim, neaku rise from the bleachers na neaku jog toward the coaches office before Kyle naidimuno finish thought enye. “Keep that file tonight, just neaku bring it back tomorrow. Love you!” \n“Yeah, yeah,” Kyle neaku say, neaku roll eyes enye na a chuckle. \nA mix o emotions neaku stir within Kyle kama neaku find himself alone e the rink once more. The weight o the decision ahead neaku loom large, ake neaku feel a flicker o hope. If there neaku a chance pee make a difference for Declan, perhaps it neaku worth neaku take the leap. \nNeaku take a deep breath, neaku glance around the rink kai memories neaku flood back once again: laughter, camaraderie, na the family neaku cherish. This new chapter neaku unfold, a fresh purpose, na maybe it neaku finally time pee embrace the unknown. \n\n“Okay, we neaku got two classic burgers, one club sandwich, na fries all around,” the waitress neaku announce cheerfully kama neaku place kila plate e the table na practiced ease. “Naidimuno naaku get you anything else?” \n“Naaku think we neaku all set, thanks, Jo,” Kyle neaku say na a warm smile kama neaku shift napkin enye onto lap enye. \nThe Barnes family neaku begin neaku dig e after the waitress neaku leave iltung’anak to it. Ryan neaku immediately reach for the ketchup na, true to form, neaku drown fries enye e an absurd amount, neaku completely unfaze by the amused glances from parents enye. \nMeaku a word, Kyle neaku pluck the pickles from burger enye na neaku place iltung’anak e plate enye o Ryan; a quiet ritual neaku long become second nature. It neaku a small thing, ake moments kama that neaku make Kyle feel grounded, kama some parts o life neaku meaku change at all. \n\nThe table neaku fall into a comfortable silence kama kila nani neaku tuck into meals enye, the clinking o silverware na the occasional satisfied hum neaku fill the space between iltung’anak. After a few minutes o quiet eating, Kyle neaku lean back slightly na neaku break the silence, neaku ready pee reconnect na family enye. \n“Alright,” neaku hum, neaku take a sip o drink enye before neaku set the glass down. “Big day for all o us, huh? Who neaku up first, any nani neaku want pee share?” \n“Oh, naaku go,” Nicole neaku say, eyes enye neaku light up. “Kama much kama naaku love you, my sidai boys, it neaku so nice pee be back at the office today. Kila nani neaku incredibly welcoming. Today neaku mostly administrative stuff, ake we neaku also talk through some upcoming projects, na naaku already itch pee dive e.” \n\nKyle neaku smile, genuinely happy pee see enye so energized. “That’s sidai, babe. You neaku be wait a long time for this.” \n“Yeah,” Ryan neaku add between bites. “Mom neaku finally neaku get pee make houses o other iltung’anak neaku look kama sidai kama ours.” \n“Exactly!” Nicole neaku coo, neaku give bicep enye o Ryan a soft pinch. “Though naaku do still expect help enyena neaku move samples around the garage, Mr. Muscles.” \nRyan neaku groan na a grin. “Neaku know that neaku come.” \nKyle neaku chuckle at banter enye, then neaku shift e seat enye, neaku drape arm enye around the back o chair enye o Ryan so naidimuno fully face enye. Kama neaku move, neaku give the back o head enye o Ryan a gentle scruff, neaku earn a mock-annoyed eye roll from olaiserr enye. \n\n“Alright, turn enyena, Champ. First day at St. Cassian’s, how neaku it go?” \nRyan neaku shrug, neaku poke at a fry. “It neaku alright.” \n“Just alright?” Nicole neaku ask, neaku raise an eyebrow. \n“Naaku mean, it neaku school. Ake the campus neaku pretty sick, na a couple o the guys e the team neaku seem sidai. Classes meaku bad either.” \nKyle neaku nod, gaze enye steady. “That’s a sidai start.” \nRyan neaku give another shrug, ake this time it neaku come na a small smile. “Yeah, naaku guess it meaku the worst first day.” \nKyle neaku begin neaku rub a slow circle between shoulder blades enye o Ryan absentmindedly, gaze enye neaku drift to the window beside iltung’anak. The sun neaku begin pee dip below the trees, neaku cast golden streaks across the diner’s parking lot, a reminder o how quickly time neaku already pass. \n\n“Hey,” Kyle neaku hum, neaku give shoulder enye o Ryan a light squeeze pee catch attention enye. “Tell mom enyena about practice. Neaku be wait all day pee hear about it.” \nRyan neaku perk up, eyes enye neaku brighten a little. “The rink neaku insane, it neaku kama NHL-level. Uncle Luc- naaku mean, Coach Luc neaku have us neaku do some light drills, mostly puck work na conditioning,” neaku say, neaku try pee keep voice enye even, though the excitement neaku peek through. \n“Yeah?” Nicole neaku lean e, genuinely curious. “Neaku it feel kama the right fit?” \nRyan neaku nod. “Yeah. Kila nani neaku really sidai, ake naaku think naaku hold own enyena. Coach Luc neaku keep it pretty easy e us for the first day, ake naaku know it neaku go pee ramp up fast.” \n\n“Naaku so glad pee hear that, baby,” Nicole neaku say, neaku reach across the table pee touch arm enye o Ryan. Fingers enye neaku shift, na neaku give chin enye a light tap na knuckle enye. “Even if that smile e the picture dad enyena neaku take this morning neaku, kama, 40% effort at best.” \n“Naaku smile, meaku naaku?” Ryan neaku laugh, neaku duck head enye. \n“Technically,” neaku tease, neaku lean back na a grin. “Naaku have half a mind pee make you neaku retake it tomorrow.” \n“Nope,” Ryan neaku say quickly, already neaku shake head enye. “Nabo per semester. That’s the rule.” \nKyle neaku chuckle into drink enye. “Neaku be keep track, apparently.” \n\nKyle neaku watch the exchange na a quiet sense o contentment, the easy rhythm between Nicole na Ryan neaku fill enye na a familiar warmth. Then gaze enye neaku drop to plate enye, the weight o the earlier conversation na Luc neaku nudge at the back o mind enye. The time neaku come pee shift gears. \nNeaku give Nicole a small smile, then neaku clear throat enye gently. \n“So, while we neaku all share big firsts today,” Kyle neaku begin, voice enye casual ake deliberate, “there neaku one more thing naaku want pee run by you guys.” \nNicole neaku look up from plate enye, brows neaku knit slightly na curiosity. “Everything okay?” \n\n“Yeah, yeah,” Kyle neaku say quickly, neaku wave a hand pee ease the concern. “It neaku nothing bad. Just…something Luc neaku bring up this morning when naaku see enye at the rink.” \nRyan neaku glance up from fries enye, neaku pick up e the subtle shift e tone enye o dad enye. Posture enye neaku straighten slightly, curiosity neaku take hold. \n“Neaku ask me for a favor,” Kyle neaku continue, neaku glance between iltung’anak. “Na it neaku kind o a big one.” \nRyan neaku raise an eyebrow, neaku still chew a fry. “Kama, neaku help enye move a couch kind o favor, or neaku help bury a body kind o favor?” \nNicole neaku shoot Ryan a disapproving look, ake Kyle naidimuno meaku help ake neaku chuckle. “It neaku somewhere e between, naaku think.” \n\nRyan neaku lean back e chair enye, neaku take a sip o drink enye. “Okay, well now naaku really curious. What neaku it?” \nKyle neaku shift e seat enye, neaku remove arm enye from the back o chair enye o Ryan na neaku lean forward slightly, neaku rest forearms enye e the table. “Luc neaku ask if we naidimuno consider neaku be a billet family this season, for a new player neaku join the team.” \nNicole neaku pause, neaku set down glass enye na a thoughtful clink. “Neaku want us pee take e a kid?” Expression enye neaku morph, less surprise na more intrigue. “That neaku definitely meaku something Luc naidimuno ask lightly.” \nKyle neaku nod. “Exactly. This kid, Declan Hull, neaku talented, meaku question. Ake home life enye neaku rocky. Luc neaku think neaku live na a stable family naidimuno really ground enye.” \n\nRyan neaku glance between parents enye, concern neaku creep into expression enye. “Wait…neaku that mean neaku go pee, kama, live na me? Naaku go pee have pee share room enyena?” \nKyle neaku meet eyes enye, neaku offer a calm look pee ease the concern. “Neaku be e the guest room, meaku worry. Na honestly, part o why Luc neaku think o us neaku because neaku say you naidimuno be a great example for enye.” \nRyan neaku lean forward, neaku mirror posture enye o dad enye na forearms e the table, brows enye neaku knit together e thought. “Why meaku neaku at practice today then? If neaku e the team, shouldn’t neaku have start na the rest o us?” \n\nKyle neaku nod, neaku understand the question. Neaku know how important it neaku for a team pee start the season together; same drills, same ice, neaku build that early chemistry. \n“Luc neaku say things neaku come together really last minute, the paperwork neaku just clear. Declan neaku get e tomorrow, ake neaku already lock e e the roster.” \nRyan neaku tilt head enye, clearly neaku still process. “Huh…that neaku kind o wild. Just neaku show up outta nowhere.” \nKyle neaku gently bump shoulder enye into Ryan’s, voice enye steady. “Life meaku always neat, Ry. This kid neaku be bounce around for years, meaku because neaku a bad kid, ake because meaku nani neaku give enye a real chance. This naidimuno be shot enye at something solid. So let’s meaku judge enye before we neaku even meet enye, okay?” \n\nRyan neaku pout slightly at the soft scolding, shoulders enye neaku sink just a bit. Neaku look down at plate enye, quiet for a moment kama neaku push a fry through the last streak o ketchup. \n“So neaku my age?” neaku ask, voice enye more thoughtful now. \nKyle neaku nod. “Same grade. Neaku turn fifteen e May,” neaku say, neaku watch Ryan closely for a reaction. \nAke nothing neaku come. Ryan neaku simply continue pee eat the last o fries enye, neaku prompt Kyle pee press on. “You okay na that?” neaku ask gently. “It neaku a big shift, naaku know.” \nRyan neaku shrug, then neaku nod slowly. “Naaku mean…yeah. Naaku get it. If neaku really need it, naaku meaku go pee be a jerk about it. Just neaku got pee wrap head enyena around neaku have a roommate now, naaku guess.” \n\nBefore Kyle naidimuno respond, Nicole neaku quickly interject. “If you meaku okay na it, that meaku make you a jerk, sweetheart. Do you neaku understand? It neaku natural pee feel unsure, na you neaku have the biggest heart naaku ever see, even when you neaku try pee hide it.” \nRyan neaku give a half-smile, eyes neaku flick toward plate enye again. \nNicole neaku glance at Kyle, then back to Ryan. “Na if this boy really neaku need a place pee land, naaku think we naidimuno be the right kind o home for enye. It meaku be perfect, na it naidimuno probably take some adjusting, ake we neaku got more pee give. We always neaku have.” \n\nNeaku look at Kyle now, na heart enye neaku swell. Neaku reach for hand enye o Nicole under the table na neaku give it a gentle squeeze. \n“Naaku think it neaku worth a shot, yeah?” Kyle neaku nod, voice enye steady kama neaku look between the two o iltung’anak. “Ake just so there neaku meaku confusion, family neaku come first. It always neaku have, na it always neaku will.” \nNicole neaku give a small, knowing smile, na Ryan neaku meet eyes enye o dad enye, neaku listen closely. \n“We neaku do best enyena pee make this work,” Kyle neaku continue, “ake if it meaku feel right, if it neaku too much or neaku cause strain e the house, then we neaku reassess. Meaku guilt. Meaku pressure. Just honesty.” \n\nNeaku pause for a beat. “Ake something neaku tell me we naidimuno be exactly what this kid neaku need.” \nNicole neaku reach for water enye na neaku nod. “Na maybe neaku exactly what we neaku need too.” \nRyan neaku lean back e seat enye, neaku nudge empty plate enye aside. “So…neaku find out naaku got a roommate now at least neaku get me a to-go milkshake or something?” \nNicole neaku raise an eyebrow, clearly neaku amuse. “Oh, we neaku negotiate now?” \n“Naaku mean, emotional growth neaku exhaust,” Ryan neaku say na a grin. “Naaku think naaku earn some sugar.” \nKyle neaku laugh, neaku reach for the check. “Fair enough. Nabo chocolate milkshake, extra whipped cream. You definitely neaku earn it.” \n\nKama neaku stand na neaku gather things enye, the air around iltung’anak neaku feel lighter. Neaku step out o the diner kama nabo, arm enye o Kyle neaku drape protectively over shoulders enye o Ryan, other hand enye neaku gently clasp Nicole’s. \nThere neaku still a lot unknown about what neaku lay ahead, ake neaku face it together. \nNa that, Kyle neaku think, neaku more than a sidai start. \nThe house neaku quiet again. The kind o quiet neaku settle e only after a full day. Kyle neaku pad barefoot down the hallway, coffee mug e nabo hand, file enye o Declan neaku tuck under arm enye. \nThe bedroom light neaku cast a warm glow across the sheets kama Nicole neaku emerge from the bathroom, neaku brush out the last bit o moisture from hair enye. Neaku wear nabo o old team t-shirts enye o Kyle, the fabric soft na oversized, sleeves neaku brush elbows enye. \n\nKyle neaku already prop up against the headboard when neaku climb into bed beside enye, neaku pull the covers over lap enye na a contented sigh. \n“Ry neaku asleep?” Nicole neaku murmur, neaku ease into side enye, fingers enye neaku brush lightly against arm enye. \n“Mhm,” Kyle neaku hum, neaku set mug enye down e the nightstand na a soft clink. The folder neaku remain open e lap enye, profile page enye o Declan neaku catch the soft pool o lamplight. Gaze enye o Nicole neaku drift to it. \n“You neaku read that three times already,” neaku say softly. \n“Yeah,” Kyle neaku admit, eyes enye neaku still e the page. “Naaku keep neaku think about how young neaku look. Neaku just a kid. Ake there neaku something e eyes enye…naaku meaku know. It neaku kama neaku already carry the weight o nani twice age enye.” \n\nNicole neaku lean head enye against shoulder enye, hand enye neaku find enye e the file na neaku rest there. “You neaku already e it, huh?” \nKyle neaku let out a breath through nose enye; half a laugh, half a sigh. “Naaku meaku know. Maybe. Naaku just…naaku keep neaku picture what it naidimuno be kama for me at age enye meaku dad enye neaku show up to kila game. Meaku nani neaku give a damn.” \nNicole neaku quiet for a moment, thumb enye neaku gently trace knuckles enye. \n“We neaku sidai at neaku give a damn,” neaku say finally, voice enye barely above a whisper. \nKyle neaku turn pee look at enye, expression enye soft. “You sure you neaku up for this? Things neaku just neaku start pee feel…balanced.” \n\n“Naaku sure,” neaku say, neaku meet eyes enye. “We neaku always make room when it neaku matter. This neaku matter.” \n“Na Ryan?” Voice enye o Kyle neaku dip, neaku lace na quiet guilt. “Naaku promise enye this next chapter naidimuno be about enye. More time together, just the two o us; hockey enye, moment enye. Na now, day one, naaku ask enye pee share all o that na a complete stranger.” \n“What if it neaku sidai for enye too?” Nicole neaku ask gently, voice enye thoughtful. “Neaku learn how pee make space for nani else. Neaku figure out who neaku e meaku just e the ice, ake kama a teammate, a friend. Maybe even a brother.” \n\nKyle neaku meaku consider that angle, meaku really. The idea neaku settle over enye slowly, unexpected ake meaku unwelcome, kama a shift e light neaku make the whole picture neaku look different. \n“Damn,” Kyle neaku murmur, a quiet smile neaku tug at lips enye. “You neaku sidai.” \nNicole neaku grin, neaku tilt head enye kama neaku bump shoulder enye against enye. “That’s why you neaku marry me, Barnes.” \n“Among a million other reasons,” neaku say, neaku lean over pee press a kiss to temple enye. “Naaku love you.” \nNeaku smirk sleepily. “Naaku love you too. Now neaku turn off that light. We neaku got another big day tomorrow.” \nKyle neaku chuckle, neaku snap the folder shut. Neaku place it gently e the nightstand beside mug enye, then neaku click off the lamp. \n\nKama darkness neaku settle around iltung’anak, neaku lay back beside enye, nabo arm beneath shoulders enye, the steady rhythm o breathing enye neaku already begin pee slow. \nNa for a long while, Kyle neaku stare at the ceiling, wide awake. \nTomorrow, everything neaku begin again. New roles. New routines. A new kid. \nA new chance."}}}

His headphones rested around his neck, the music paused a while ago, but he hadn’t noticed. He’d spent the last hour watching pine trees blur past the window, wondering if this place would be like the others.\n\nTemporary.\nWith a slow exhale, Declan rose to his feet, slinging the duffel bag over his shoulder. The blue canvas was stiff and new, the St. Cassian’s crest embroidered in gold on the side. It had been overnighted to him in anticipation for his arrival, along with his class uniform and team-issued hockey sweats. He’d conveniently ignored the uniform, pulling on the sweats instead. After seven hours crammed on a bus from Syracuse, he dared someone to say a word about him showing up late and out of dress code. \nThe driver gave him a brief nod as he stepped off the bus.\n\nThe fall air was colder than he expected, brisk and sharp as it hit his lungs. He zipped his windbreaker up higher and adjusted his grip on the bag. His eyes scanned the wide campus, tracing the stone buildings and manicured lawns with casual disinterest until they landed on the rink in the distance.\nThere it was. The reason he was here.\nHockey was the one thing that always made sense, even when everything else didn’t.\nOn the ice, he was free. He could move how he wanted, think how he wanted, and he was good . Nothing else in his life had ever been that simple.\n\nHe shifted his bag higher on his shoulder, drawn toward the rink like muscle memory. His feet started moving without him even really deciding to. Then a voice snapped him out of it.\n“Excuse me, sweetheart! New arrival?”\nAn older woman in a St. Cassian’s blazer was waving him down from the main entrance, clipboard in hand and a no-nonsense energy that made him stop in his tracks.\n“Uh, yeah,” he said, squinting against the sun. “I’m Declan. Declan Hull.”\n“Oh, hi, Declan.” She smiled as she caught up to him, a little out of breath but friendly. “I’m Heather Burke, Director of Admissions.” She extended her hand with practiced warmth, like she’d done this a hundred times before.\n\n“Hi,” Declan said, reaching out to shake her hand. His grip was firm, but quick; polite enough, though his eyes kept drifting back toward the rink.\nShe noticed the way his gaze kept pulling back to the rink and smiled knowingly.\n“You’re ready to get after it, aren’t you?” she said with a spark of encouragement. “Well, no point in delaying. I know your coaches are looking forward to meeting you. Shall we?”\nShe turned, already walking toward the rink, trusting he’d follow.\nDeclan didn’t say a word, just adjusted his grip on the duffel and fell in step, eyes fixed straight ahead.\n\n”So,” she hummed, breaking the silence, “you missed the first two days of classes. I’ve got all your classwork and homework here.” \nShe handed him a folder as they walked; blue and gold, stamped with the school crest in shiny foil. Declan almost rolled his eyes. Even the homework was branded.\n“Normally, we have a zero-tolerance policy for late work,” she continued. “But given the circumstances, you’ll have until the end of the week to get it turned in. If you need a tutor to help you catch up, that can be arranged.”\nDeclan’s brain buzzed, already overloaded by the flood of expectations and deadlines. Heather must’ve picked up on it. She gave him a brief pat on the back, like that would somehow make it better.\n\n\"Don’t worry, everything you need to know is in the school handbook,\" she said, her tone casual, as though she was well-accustomed to the overwhelmed look on new students’ faces.\nRight . The endless handbook they emailed over. As if he’d actually sit down and read all that.\nBefore Declan’s brain could short-circuit from the overload, Heather pushed open the doors to the rink. The blast of cold air hit him like a welcome shock, instantly calming the chaos in his head.\nFinally. \n“Coach Benoit’s office is just through here,” Heather said, leading him down the hallway. \nShe knocked on the door, and it swung open immediately. The man who stepped into view was the same one from the school website photo, his broad smile instantly recognizable. He beamed at Declan like an old friend.\n\n“Declan!” he exclaimed with enthusiasm, his smile widening. “Welcome to St. Cassian’s. How was the ride in?”\n“Long,” Declan said with a shrug, the weight of the journey still lingering in his voice. “But I’m just glad to finally be here.”\nLuc stepped forward with a confident handshake, his grip firm but welcoming. “We’re thrilled to have you on board.” He turned to Heather with a smile. “Mrs. Burke, thank you for making the trek out to The Den.”\nShe waved him off with an easy smile. “Anytime. If you need me, you know where to find me.” With a final nod, she turned and swept out, her heels clicking in steady rhythm across the rink floor.\n\n“Come on in, Declan,” Luc said as he opened the door and stepped aside to let him through.\nDeclan walked in but hesitated a few steps past the threshold. His gaze landed on a man already in the room, someone he recognized. His posture stiffened.\n”Whoa, wait. You’re Kyle Barnes,” Declan said, the corners of his mouth lifting for the first time all day. The weight of the bus ride, the nerves, the folder full of homework gone for a moment.\nKyle’s smile was easy, confident. He stepped forward and extended a hand.\n“Nice to meet you, Declan. I’ve heard a lot about you.”\n\nDeclan shook his hand, barely keeping the awe off his face. A breath slipped out, half disbelief, half nerves, and before he could stop himself, his mouth got ahead of his brain.\n“I had you on my fantasy team last year. Not gonna lie, you lost me the championship.”\nDeclan pressed his lips together the second the words left his mouth, the grin fading as panic crept in. Nice one, he thought. Way to chirp an NHL vet five minutes into meeting him. He resisted the urge to bury his face in his hands.\nA snicker sounded behind him. Declan glanced over his shoulder to see Coach Luc with a hand half-covering his mouth, doing a poor job of hiding his amusement. \n\nKyle nodded, the corners of his mouth twitching as he fought back a smile. “Is that right? Sorry to let you down. Guess it’s a good thing I hung up the skates when I did, spare a few more fantasy teams the heartbreak.”\nDeclan opened his mouth, then quickly shut it again, heat creeping up the back of his neck. “I mean…your Cup run with the Kings was insane, though. That game seven OT goal? Unreal.” He scratched the back of his neck. “So… uh, what are you doing at St. Cassian’s? Are you coaching here now? I didn’t see you on the website.”\n\nLuc settled into his chair, the leather creaking softly as he leaned back, then gestured to the seat across from him. “That’s actually what we wanted to talk to you about.”\nDeclan dropped into the chair, his duffel still slung across one shoulder, curiosity flickering behind his eyes. He wasn’t sure what he expected, but something about Luc’s tone made him sit a little straighter.\nLuc leaned forward, resting his forearms on the desk, his tone shifting; slower now, more deliberate. He glanced over at Kyle, then back to Declan.\n“Coming to a new school like St. Cassian’s is no small thing. You’re stepping into a new environment, away from home, with big expectations; on the ice, in the classroom, socially. That’s a lot for anyone, even a kid with your talent.”\n\nHe let the words breathe for a moment, letting them land before continuing.\n“When we found out you’d be joining us, one of the first conversations we had was about how to make that transition easier for you. Where you’d land. Who you’d be around. Not just where you sleep at night, but where you’d feel like you had solid ground beneath you.”\nLuc nodded toward Kyle. “Kyle and his family moved here this summer. His son, Ryan, is one of your new teammates. His wife, Nicole, she’s the kind of person who makes a place feel like home the second you walk in. And Kyle? Well, you know who he is.”\n\nHe paused again, not for dramatic effect, but because it mattered.\n“He’s not on the coaching staff, at least not officially. But he’s part of something new we’re building here. A different kind of support system; player development, mentorship, leadership off the ice as much as on. And we want you to be part of that.”\nLuc’s smile came easy, a little crooked. “So, here’s the offer: Kyle and his family have opened their home to you. If you’re open to it, we think it’s a great fit. But no pressure. We wanted to bring it to you first.”\nDeclan blinked, caught off guard. He hadn’t expected this. At all.\n\nEvery boarding school he’d been to had followed the same formula; dorms, roommates, shared bathrooms, and noise. This? Living off-campus? With a former NHL player and his family? That was…new. \nHe glanced between Luc and Kyle, trying to read between the lines, to figure out if this was really optional or just dressed up to feel that way.\n“I thought I’d be living on campus,” he said finally, his voice quieter, not confrontational, just honest.\nLuc nodded, like he’d anticipated that reaction. “Totally fair. And yeah, most students do. But with your background, and the level we expect you to compete at, we wanted to try something a little different. Give you a foundation.”\n\nDeclan shifted in his seat, still trying to wrap his head around it. Living with Kyle Barnes. Having breakfast across the table from the guy who used to light it up in the league. It was a lot to take in.\nKyle let out a soft chuckle, picking up on the hesitation in Declan’s eyes. “It’s a lot to process, huh?”\nDeclan didn’t answer, but the look on his face said enough. He watched Kyle carefully, the weight of it all pressing in.\nKyle leaned back in his chair, settling into a more relaxed posture, but his eyes stayed sharp and knowing. “I’ve been where you’re sitting. New town. New team. Big pressure. It can mess with your head if you let it.”\n\nDeclan’s mind flickered through every worry he’d been carrying since stepping off that bus. Was Kyle reading him that easily? It felt like he was peeling back layers without even trying. That low, familiar buzz of uncertainty crept up again, and somehow, Kyle seemed to catch it without a word.\n“I know it’s not easy, kid.” Kyle gave a small, almost fatherly sigh. His voice was lower now; gentle, but steady. “But here’s the thing. If you stay with us, you’re not just crashing at a billet house. I’m offering you space to breathe. A place to land when everything else feels like it’s spinning.”\n\nDeclan felt his throat tighten. Like the room had gone still for a second.\n“Hockey’s a hell of a ride,” Kyle went on, “and yeah, I’ll push you. But I’ll have your back every step of the way. This isn’t just about stats or ice time, it’s about becoming the kind of player, the kind of person, who can handle the long haul. And I’ve been through the trenches. I know what that takes.”\nHe folded his arms casually, the edge in his voice softening into something more inviting. “It’s a big decision, I get that. So here’s what I’m thinking, you crash with us tonight. No pressure. See the house, meet Nicole and Ryan. Feel it out. Then tomorrow, if it feels right, we’ll talk.”\n\nDeclan didn’t even realize he was nodding until the motion was halfway done.\nSomething about the way Kyle spoke; calm, direct, like he actually got it. It cut through the usual static in Declan’s brain. He didn’t know what was happening, not really. Just that, for some reason, this guy already had a kind of hold on him. Not in a forced way. Just…steady. Solid. Like someone who meant what he said and wouldn’t flake the second things got hard.\nNo adult had ever made him feel that before. Not a teacher. Not a coach. Not even his own dad. \n\nSo yeah, maybe he wasn’t sure about any of this, but his head kept nodding anyway.\n“Okay,” he said finally. “I’ll give it a shot.”\nLuc and Kyle exchanged a quick smile, something quiet and satisfied passing between them.\n\"Great!\" Luc said, his enthusiasm palpable. He leaned forward, a spark in his eyes. \"Any questions or anything on your mind before you head out to practice?\"\nDeclan paused, the question hanging in the air for a moment. He glanced between Luc and Kyle, then shook his head. \"I think I’m good for now.\"\n\"Alright, go ahead and get settled in,\" Luc said, standing up and motioning toward the hallway. \"Locker room's down the hall to the right. Your name’s on one of the stalls, and your gear's already waiting for you.\"\n\nDeclan rose to his feet, clutching the duffel a little tighter.\nLuc gave him a nod. “Practice starts in twenty. Coach Reynolds will meet you on the ice.”\nKyle stood too, that same calm energy still radiating off him. “I’ll see you after. Nicole’s making chicken parm tonight. Hope you’re hungry.”\nDeclan gave a half-smile without meaning to. “Yeah. Sounds good.”\nAnd with that, he turned and headed for the hallway, trying not to overthink the million things racing through his head.\nPractice flew by in a blur of crisp passes, sharp turns, and the unmistakable rush that only came when his skates hit fresh ice. Declan didn’t need time to adjust to that, his instincts kicked in from the first drill. It wasn’t long before heads were turning and quiet nods of approval passed between coaches.\n\nIt felt good. Easy. Like slipping into something that had always fit.\nThe locker room buzzed with post-practice energy; snapping tape, the thud of gear hitting benches, and a steady stream of chirps flying from stall to stall.\n“Not bad for the new guy,” one of the defensemen called, grinning as he peeled off his jersey. \nDeclan smirked as he unstrapped his pads. “Figured I’d show up, impress a little, then humble you tomorrow.”\nA few guys let out loud “Oooohs,” one of them chucking a rolled-up sock at him.\nAs he dodged the sock, Declan caught Ryan watching him from across the room. Not in a hostile way, just…quietly. Studying. Like he was still deciding what to make of him.\n\nBefore Declan could read into it, Ryan stood, tugged his hoodie over damp hair, and headed out without a word.\nThe rest of the guys were still laughing and joking around, but that moment stuck.\nDeclan finished peeling off his gear and slung the duffel over his shoulder. When he stepped out into the hallway, he spotted them; Kyle and Ryan, standing just outside the rink doors. Kyle’s hand rested on his son’s shoulder, his voice low and calm, the kind of tone only a dad could pull off.\nRyan nodded at something, eyes on the ground. Declan didn’t catch what was said, but he could tell instantly that they were close. Really close.\n\nIt hit him in a way he didn’t expect.\nKyle glanced up and spotted Declan, a smile already forming as he lifted a hand in an easy wave. “There he is. You survive your first Coach Luc practice?”\nDeclan nodded, catching up to them. “Barely,” he said, though the grin tugging at the corner of his mouth gave him away.\nRyan gave him a short glance, but didn’t say much. Just gave a subtle nod, then walked ahead toward the parking lot.\n“Come on,” Kyle said, clapping a hand gently on Declan’s back. “Let’s get you home.”\nHome. The word sounded weird in his head. But as he followed them to the car, something in his chest loosened, just a little.\n\nThe car ride was quiet in a way Declan hadn’t realized he’d been craving. No one asked him questions or tried to fill the silence with small talk. Ryan had earbuds in, staring out his window. Kyle kept one hand on the wheel, the other resting casually on the console, humming now and then to the classic rock playing softly through the speakers.\nDeclan leaned his head against the window and watched the world roll by. The narrow roads wound through thick trees brushed with the first touches of fall; burnt oranges, deep reds, and gold. It was nothing like the city. The quiet felt intentional here. Peaceful.\n\nHe hadn’t noticed any of this from the bus, just the ache in his back and the buzz of nerves. But now…now it didn’t seem so bad.\nThe car turned off the main road and onto a quiet, tree-lined street, the tires humming softly against the worn asphalt. Declan glanced out the window, taking in the quaint homes tucked into the hillsides, most with wide porches and tidy yards. Everything felt still out here, like the whole world had taken a breath and held it.\nThey pulled into a modest driveway in front of a two-story house with deep blue siding and white trim. Warm yellow light glowed from the windows, casting a soft welcome as twilight settled over the neighborhood.\n\nKyle eased the car into park, the soft hum of the engine cutting through the quiet of the evening. He turned to look at Declan with a small smile. “This is us. Home sweet home,” he said, his tone light but with a quiet certainty, as if he were laying down an unspoken promise.\nDeclan didn’t answer, but he opened the door and stepped out. The air smelled faintly of pine and chimney smoke. Calmer than anything he’d felt in weeks.\nRyan was already unlocking the front door, his silhouette framed by the porch light.\nKyle gave Declan’s shoulder a gentle tap before heading up the steps. “Come on. Nicole’s got dinner waiting, and she’s been asking about you all day.”\n\nThe door swung open with a quiet creak, and warm air spilled out into the cool evening, carrying the unmistakable smell of garlic and tomato sauce. Declan stepped inside behind Kyle, the hardwood floors smooth under his sneakers and the house glowing with soft, ambient light that gave it a lived-in, welcoming feel.\n“Hi!” a voice called from the kitchen. A moment later, a woman stepped out, wiping her hands on a dish towel. She was tall, athletic, with a sharp but warm energy that instantly filled the space. “You must be Declan.”\nDeclan hesitated for a moment, caught in the awkwardness of the moment. He nodded, unsure whether to wave or offer a handshake, his mind scrambling for a response. “Uh, yeah. Hi.”\n\nBefore he could say anything else, Nicole stepped forward, her arms open in a welcoming embrace. She pulled him into a hug without missing a beat.\n“It’s so nice to meet you!” she said, rubbing his back gently in a motherly way before pulling back from the hug. “I’m Nicole. Hope you’re hungry, I made chicken parm. It’s a family favorite.”\n“Yeah…starving, actually.”\nRyan had already disappeared upstairs, his footsteps fading above them, leaving the three of them in the open kitchen and living room. Declan took in the house. Family photos lined the walls, the dining table was half-set, and the smell from the kitchen was enough to make his stomach growl. Everything felt grounded, like people lived here and liked living here.\n\nNicole gestured toward a stool at the island. “Sit, relax. Dinner’ll be ready in a few. Any food allergies I should know about?”\n“Nope.”\nKyle was already pulling plates from the cabinet. “He held his own at practice,” he said casually over his shoulder, like it was no big deal.\nNicole raised a brow at Declan. “Impressive. First day and already showing off?”\nHe shrugged, a flicker of pride sneaking into his chest. “Just trying to keep up.”\nIt felt…comfortable in a way he hadn’t expected. Like maybe, for once, he wouldn’t have to brace himself all the time.\nBy the time they sat down for dinner, that feeling hadn't gone away.\n\nDeclan hesitated only for a second before sliding into his seat next to Ryan, who was already digging in like it was a competitive sport. He glanced at his own portion and, after a quick taste, instantly understood why. The chicken parm was insanely good.\nDeclan took another bite, savoring the perfect balance of crispy breading and rich marinara. The flavors were way better than he expected, so much so that he couldn't help but mutter, “This is fucking good.”\nThe second the words left his mouth, the room fell dead silent. Ryan’s fork froze halfway to his mouth, his eyes snapping up to Declan with a mixture of shock and disbelief, like Declan had just unleashed a bomb at the dinner table. \n\nDeclan, unaware of the shift, continued chewing, casually glancing around the table, still absorbed in the taste of his food.\nThen he noticed it. The tension. The quiet.\nKyle’s voice broke the silence, calm but carrying an unmistakable authority. “Declan,” he said, his tone measured. “We don’t use that kind of language, especially not at the dinner table.”\nDeclan blinked, caught off guard. “Oh. Um, we...we’re hockey players though,” he shrugged, trying to brush it off. “It's kind of part of the deal.”\nKyle didn’t smile. His face remained impassive, though there was a flicker of something in his eyes, a reminder that this wasn’t some casual request. “Maybe on the ice, yeah, but even then, you’re too young for that kind of talk.”\n\nDeclan’s brow furrowed, his words tripping over themselves. “You- what?”\nKyle’s gaze was steady, never wavering. “In this house, we keep it clean. We respect the people we’re around.”\nDeclan's confusion was evident as he leaned over to Ryan, lowering his voice. “You don’t talk like that?” he asked, genuinely curious, not sure what to make of it all.\nBefore Ryan could answer, Nicole's voice rang out, light but firm. “Not if he doesn’t want soap in his mouth.”\nRyan’s eyes widened comically, panic creeping into his voice. “Mom!”\nNicole didn’t bat an eye. “Just saying,” she added with a knowing smirk.\n\nDeclan’s chest tightened. Soap in his mouth? Was she serious? He shot a look toward Kyle, but there was no humor in his eyes, just a quiet, resolute discipline.\nKyle cleared his throat and leaned back, his expression softening just enough to show he wasn’t angry, but he wasn’t backing down either. \n“Look, we get it. Hockey culture, the locker room, it’s different. We don’t mind a little edge when it's warranted, but when you're in my house, there are lines we don’t cross.” He gave Declan a pointed look, making sure the weight of the words settled. “You’re not just here to play hockey, you’re here to grow. And that means learning discipline, both on and off the ice.”\n\nDeclan couldn’t deny the way those words landed on him. His gut twisted a little, not from anger, but from something else. It wasn’t exactly comfort , but maybe that’s what he needed: boundaries. \nRyan eyed him again, his face unreadable now, like he was sizing Declan up all over again. Nicole, on the other hand, was already back to plating up another round of food, acting like nothing had happened. But Declan could tell, this family didn’t mess around.\nDeclan let out a small exhale, unsure what to say. “Yeah, sure. Sorry about that.” \nHe leaned back in his chair and stared at his plate, trying to collect his thoughts. The sudden shift in atmosphere threw him off. \n\nKyle nodded, his voice softening again, but still carrying that same steady cadence. “It’s okay.” His mouth quirked in reassurance. “Alright. Now, eat up.”\nDeclan met Kyle’s gaze. He nodded, offering a sheepish grin. \nRyan, still eyeing him like he’d just seen a rare species, let out a quiet sigh and turned his attention back to his food. Kyle gave Ryan a look that was all too familiar, a mix of casual suggestion and quiet command. \n“Hey, after dinner why don’t you help Declan get started on his homework?”\nRyan immediately groaned, his fork clattering against his plate. “I’m not a tutor.”\n\nKyle didn’t flinch. He just raised his eyebrows, the eyebrows, stern but patient. The kind that said: You sure about that answer, kid?\nRyan deflated with a dramatic sigh, like he’d just been asked to scrub the entire rink with a toothbrush. “Dad, come on, I’ve got my own homework to finish. And I’m seriously wiped out.” He slouched even further, practically melting into his seat.\nBefore the tension could stretch any further, Declan spoke up, casually throwing Ryan a lifeline. “It’s fine. Mrs. Burke said I could get a tutor or something to catch up. No big deal.”\nKyle kept an eyebrow raised at Ryan, then looked back at Declan with a nod. “That works. We’ll talk to the school tomorrow, get someone lined up for you.”\n\nRyan shot Declan a look, something between surprised and quietly grateful. He didn’t say thank you, but his shoulders dropped a little, the way they do when someone realizes they’ve just been spared.\nDeclan just shrugged, like it wasn’t a big deal. \nNicole bit back a smile. “Don’t worry about Ryan. He’s a lot more agreeable when there’s dessert on the line.”\nRyan groaned once again from his seat. “You act like I’m some kind of dessert-driven gremlin.”\nKyle laughed and stood, stretching. “Aren’t you?”\nNicole gave Declan a conspiratorial wink. “He once folded all the laundry in the house for a slice of triple chocolate cake. Don’t let the brooding fool you.”\n\n“I was ten.”\nDeclan smirked. “Good to know. I’ll keep chocolate cake in mind if I ever need a favor.”\nThe tight coil of nerves in his chest loosened just a little. The way they all moved around each other felt…safe.\nHe hadn’t realized how much he’d missed that kind of energy. Or maybe how little he’d ever had it in the first place.\nAfter the last dish was rinsed and stacked, the clatter of plates gave way to the softer sounds of evening settling in. Kyle dried his hands on a kitchen towel and nodded toward the hallway. “C’mon, kid. Let’s get you set up.”\n\nNicole offered a gentle smile, already halfway up the stairs with a fresh set of linens tucked under her arm. Declan followed, duffel slung over one shoulder, the adrenaline of the day slowly giving way to exhaustion. \nThe guest room was just off the staircase, second door on the left. When Nicole pushed it open, Declan blinked, surprised.\nThe room was a lot bigger than he expected.\nNot massive, but comfortably spacious. Soft gray walls, a queen bed with a green comforter and a real headboard, not the cinderblock-and-mattress setup he was used to. A big window overlooked the backyard, and a framed print of TD Garden hung over the dresser. A small desk sat under a shelf lined with books and picture frames. It didn’t feel like a guest room. \n\n“Wow,” he muttered. “This is… seriously nice.”\nBehind him, Kyle chuckled. “Look at that. You didn’t even drop an F-bomb this time.”\nDeclan shot him a smirk over his shoulder. “I’m learning.”\nNicole grinned as she set a folded blanket at the foot of the bed. “Fast learner, too. That’s good news.”\nKyle knocked gently on the door connecting to the bathroom. “You and Ryan share this. Jack and Jill setup. Two sinks, one shower. Just don’t spend an hour in there or he’ll lose it.”\n“Noted,” Declan said, still eyeing the space like it might vanish if he blinked.\n\nNicole gave the comforter one last fluff. “Let us know if you need anything. Seriously. Make yourself at home.”\nKyle nodded once, giving him a brief clap on the shoulder. “Big day tomorrow, so get some rest.”\nNicole lingered for a second longer, then stepped forward and wrapped Declan in a quick, warm hug. He froze for half a beat, caught off guard, before awkwardly returning it.\n“Good night, love,” she said softly, giving his arm a gentle squeeze before stepping back.\nDeclan blinked, unsure what to do with the sudden warmth in his chest. No one had called him that in…well, maybe ever.\n\n“Night,” Declan mumbled, voice low.\nKyle paused at the door, gave him a look that was genuine. “We’re glad you’re here, Declan. Really.”\nAnd just like that, they left him to it. The door left slightly ajar, like a quiet sign he wasn’t on his own here.\nDeclan stood for a moment, duffel still in hand, just taking it in. The house was quiet now, except for the faint sound of a TV down the hall and the occasional creak of floorboards.\nHe let out a long breath, dropped his bag by the desk, and sat on the edge of the bed. \nHe kicked off his shoes and lay back, hands behind his head, eyes tracing the ceiling. Through the door of the Jack and Jill bathroom, he could hear faint movement; Ryan brushing his teeth maybe, or just walking around his own room. \nA shared wall, a shared life, starting now.\nMaybe this year wouldn’t suck.", "video": null, "screenshot": null, "prompt_instruction": "You are a professional English-to-Maasai translator, tasked with providing translations suitable for use in Kenya (mas_KE).

Naaku get pooki classwork na homework ene.” \nNeaku hand naa folder kama neaku walk; blue na gold, stamped na crest o school e shiny foil. Declan almost neaku roll eyes. Hata homework neaku branded.\n“Normally, naaku zero-tolerance policy pee late work,” neaku continue. “Ake given circumstances, naaku have apa end o week pee get ena turned e. Pe naaku need tutor pee help naa catch up, ena naidimuno arrange.”\nBrain o Declan neaku buzz, already overloaded o flood o expectations na deadlines. Heather must’ve neaku pick up e ena. Neaku give naa brief pat e back, kama ena naidimuno make ena better.\n\n“Meaku worry, pooki naaku need pee naimanyua neaku e school handbook,” neaku aisho, tone enye casual, kama neaku well-accustomed e overwhelmed look e faces o students o new.\nRight. Handbook o endless neaku emailed over. Kama naaku actually sit down na read pooki ena.\nApa brain o Declan naidimuno short-circuit o overload, Heather neaku push open doors e rink. Blast o cold air neaku hit naa kama shock o welcome, instantly calming chaos e head enye.\nFinally. \n“Office o Coach Benoit neaku just through ene,” Heather neaku aisho, leading naa down hallway. \nNeaku knock e door, na neaku swing open immediately. Oltung’ani neaku step e view neaku same nabo o photo o school website, smile o broad instantly recognizable. Neaku beam e Declan kama friend o old.\n\n“Declan!” neaku exclaim na enthusiasm, smile enye widening. “Welcome e St. Cassian’s. Kai neaku ride e?”\n“Long,” Declan neaku aisho na shrug, weight o journey still lingering e voice enye. “Ake naaku just glad pee finally be ene.”\nLuc neaku step forward na handshake o confident, grip enye firm ake welcoming. “Naaku thrilled pee have naa e board.” Neaku turn e Heather na smile. “Mrs. Burke, shukuru pee making trek out e The Den.”\nNeaku wave naa off na smile o easy. “Anytime. Pe naaku need naa, naaku naimanyua kai naidimuno naishori naa.” Na final nod, neaku turn na sweep out, heels enye clicking e rhythm o steady e rink floor.\n\n“Come e, Declan,” Luc neaku aisho kama neaku open door na step aside pee let naa through.\nDeclan neaku walk e ake hesitate smol steps past threshold. Gaze enye neaku land e oltung’ani already e room, nani neaku recognize. Posture enye neaku stiffen.\n“Whoa, wait. Naaku Kyle Barnes,” Declan neaku aisho, corners o mouth enye lifting pee first time pooki olaiserr. Weight o bus ride, nerves, folder full o homework gone pee moment.\nSmile o Kyle neaku easy, confident. Neaku step forward na extend hand.\n“Nice pee meet naa, Declan. Naaku hear smol about naa.”\n\nDeclan neaku shake hand enye, barely keeping awe off face enye. Breath neaku slip out, half disbelief, half nerves, na apa naidimuno stop naa, mouth enye neaku get ahead o brain enye.\n“Naaku have naa e fantasy team last year. Meaku gonna lie, naaku lose naa championship.”\nDeclan neaku press lips together second words neaku leave mouth enye, grin fading kama panic neaku creep e. Nice nabo, neaku naimanyua. Way pee chirp NHL vet five minutes e meeting naa. Neaku resist urge pee bury face e hands enye.\nSnicker neaku sound behind naa. Declan neaku glance e shoulder pee naishori Coach Luc na hand half-covering mouth enye, doing poor job o hiding amusement. \n\nKyle neaku nod, corners o mouth enye twitching kama neaku fight back smile. “Neaku right? Sorry pee let naa down. Guess neaku sidai thing naaku hang up skates pe naaku entoki, spare smol more fantasy teams heartbreak.”\nDeclan neaku open mouth, apa quickly shut ena again, heat creeping up back o neck enye. “Naaku mean… Cup run injo na Kings neaku insane, hata. Ena game seven OT goal? Unreal.” Neaku scratch back o neck enye. “Na… uh, mbaa naaku entoki e St. Cassian’s? Naaku coaching ene lelo? Meaku naishori naa e website.”\n\nLuc neaku settle e chair enye, leather creaking softly kama neaku lean back, apa gesture e seat across o naa. “Ena neaku actually mbaa naaku want pee talk e naa about.”\nDeclan neaku drop e chair, duffel still slung e nabo shoulder, curiosity flickering behind eyes enye. Meaku sure mbaa neaku expect, ake smol about tone o Luc neaku make naa sit smol straighter.\nLuc neaku lean forward, resting forearms e desk, tone enye shifting; slower lelo, more deliberate. Neaku glance e Kyle, apa back e Declan.\n“Coming e school o new kama St. Cassian’s meaku smol thing. Naaku stepping e environment o new, away o home, na expectations o big; e ice, e classroom, socially. Ena neaku smol pee nani, hata ilaiserr na talent injo.”\n\nNeaku let words breathe pee moment, letting naaku land apa continuing.\n“Pe naaku naishori naaku joining naaku, nabo o first conversations naaku have neaku about kai pee make transition easier pee naa. Kai naaku land. Nani naaku be around. Meaku just kai naaku sleep e olaiserr, ake kai naaku feel kama naaku have ground o solid beneath naa.”\nLuc neaku nod e Kyle. “Kyle na family enye neaku move ene lelo summer. Son enye, Ryan, neaku nabo o teammates injo o new. Wife enye, Nicole, neaku kind o oltung’ani neaku make place feel kama home second naaku walk e. Na Kyle? Ake, naaku naimanyua nani neaku.”\n\nNeaku pause again, meaku pee dramatic effect, ake amu neaku matter.\n“Meaku e coaching staff, at least meaku officially. Ake neaku part o smol o new naaku building ene. Support system o different; player development, mentorship, leadership off ice kama smol kama e. Na naaku want naa pee be part o ena.”\nSmile o Luc neaku come easy, smol crooked. “Na, ene neaku offer: Kyle na family enye neaku open home enye e naa. Pe naaku open e ena, naaku naimanyua neaku fit o sidai. Ake meaku pressure. Naaku want pee bring ena e naa first.”\nDeclan neaku blink, caught off guard. Meaku expect ena. At all.\n\nKila boarding school neaku be e neaku follow same formula; dorms, roommates, bathrooms o shared, na noise. Ena? Living off-campus? Na family o NHL player o former? Ena neaku…new. \nNeaku glance e Luc na Kyle, naipirri read e lines, pee naimanyua pe ena neaku really optional ai just dressed up pee feel ena way.\n“Naaku naimanyua naaku be living e campus,” neaku aisho finally, voice enye quieter, meaku confrontational, just honest.\nLuc neaku nod, kama neaku anticipate reaction ena. “Totally fair. Na eey, most students entoki. Ake na background injo, na level naaku expect naa pee compete e, naaku want pee try smol o different. Give naa foundation.”\n\nDeclan neaku shift e seat, still naipirri wrap head enye around ena. Living na Kyle Barnes. Having breakfast e table na oltung’ani neaku light ena up e league. Neaku smol pee take e.\nKyle neaku let out chuckle o soft, picking up e hesitation e eyes o Declan. “Neaku smol pee process, huh?”\nDeclan meaku answer, ake look e face enye neaku aisho enough. Neaku watch Kyle carefully, weight o pooki pressing e.\nKyle neaku lean back e chair, settling e posture o more relaxed, ake eyes enye neaku stay sharp na knowing. “Naaku be kai naaku sitting. Town o new. Team o new. Pressure o big. Naidimuno mess na head injo pe naaku let ena.”\n\nMind o Declan neaku flicker through kila worry neaku be carrying apa stepping off bus ena. Neaku Kyle reading naa ena easily? Neaku feel kama neaku peeling back layers meaku even naipirri. Buzz o low, familiar o uncertainty neaku creep up again, na somehow, Kyle neaku seem pee catch ena meaku word.\n“Naaku naimanyua meaku easy, ilaiserr.” Kyle neaku give sigh o smol, almost fatherly. Voice enye neaku lower lelo; gentle, ake steady. “Ake ene neaku thing. Pe naaku stay na naaku, meaku just crashing e billet house. Naaku offering naa space pee breathe. Place pee land pe pooki else neaku feel kama neaku spinning.”\n\nDeclan neaku feel throat enye tighten. Kama room neaku go still pee second.\n“Hockey neaku hell o ride,” Kyle neaku go e, “na eey, naaku push naa. Ake naaku have back injo kila step o way. Ena meaku just about stats ai ice time, neaku about becoming kind o player, kind o oltung’ani, neaku naidimuno handle long haul. Na naaku be through trenches. Naaku naimanyua mbaa ena takes.”\nNeaku fold arms casually, edge e voice enye softening e smol o more inviting. “Neaku decision o big, naaku get ena. Na ene mbaa naaku naimanyua, naaku crash na naaku lelo olaiserr. Meaku pressure. Naishori house, meet Nicole na Ryan. Feel ena out. Apa tomorrow, pe ena neaku feel right, naaku talk.”\n\nDeclan meaku even realize neaku nodding apa motion neaku halfway done.\nSmol about kai Kyle neaku aisho; calm, direct, kama neaku actually get ena. Neaku cut through static o usual e brain o Declan. Meaku naimanyua mbaa neaku happening, meaku really. Just ena, pee smol reason, oltung’ani enaa already neaku kind o hold e naa. Meaku e way o forced. Just…steady. Solid. Kama nani neaku mean mbaa neaku aisho na meaku flake second things neaku get hard.\nMeaku adult neaku ever make naa feel ena apa. Meaku teacher. Meaku coach. Meaku hata dad enye. \n\nNa eey, maybe meaku sure about nani o ena, ake head enye neaku keep nodding anyway.\n“Okay,” neaku aisho finally. “Naaku give ena shot.”\nLuc na Kyle neaku exchange smile o quick, smol quiet na satisfied passing e iltung’anak.\n\"Great!\" Luc neaku aisho, enthusiasm enye palpable. Neaku lean forward, spark e eyes enye. \"Nani questions ai nani e mind injo apa naaku head out e practice?\"\nDeclan neaku pause, question hanging e air pee moment. Neaku glance e Luc na Kyle, apa shake head enye. \"Naaku naimanyua naaku sidai pee lelo.\"\n\"Alright, go ahead na get settled e,\" Luc neaku aisho, standing up na motioning e hallway. \"Locker room neaku down hall e right. Name injo neaku e nabo o stalls, na gear injo neaku already waiting pee naa.\"\n\nDeclan neaku rise e feet, clutching duffel smol tighter.\nLuc neaku give naa nod. “Practice neaku start e twenty. Coach Reynolds naaku meet naa e ice.”\nKyle neaku stand too, same calm energy still radiating off naa. “Naaku naishori naa apa. Nicole neaku making chicken parm lelo olaiserr. Hope naaku hungry.”\nDeclan neaku give half-smile meaku meaning e. “Eey. Sounds sidai.”\nNa na ena, neaku turn na head pee hallway, naipirri meaku overthink million things racing e head enye.\nPractice neaku fly o blur o passes o crisp, turns o sharp, na rush o unmistakable neaku only come pe skates enye neaku hit ice o fresh. Declan meaku need time pee adjust e ena, instincts enye neaku kick e o first drill. Meaku long apa heads neaku turning na nods o quiet o approval neaku pass e coaches.\n\nNeaku feel sidai. Easy. Kama slipping e smol neaku always fit.\nLocker room neaku buzz na energy o post-practice; snapping tape, thud o gear hitting benches, na stream o chirps o steady flying o stall e stall.\n“Meaku bad pee guy o new,” nabo o defensemen neaku call, grinning kama neaku peel off jersey enye. \nDeclan neaku smirk kama neaku unstrap pads enye. “Naaku figure naaku show up, impress smol, apa humble naa tomorrow.”\nSmol guys neaku let out loud “Oooohs,” nabo o iltung’anak chucking sock o rolled-up e naa.\nKama neaku dodge sock, Declan neaku catch Ryan watching naa o across room. Meaku e way o hostile, just…quietly. Studying. Kama neaku still deciding mbaa pee make o naa.\n\nApa Declan naidimuno read e ena, Ryan neaku stand, tug hoodie e hair o damp, na head out meaku word.\nRest o guys neaku still laughing na joking around, ake moment ena neaku stick.\nDeclan neaku finish peeling off gear enye na sling duffel e shoulder enye. Pe neaku step out e hallway, neaku spot iltung’anak; Kyle na Ryan, standing just outside rink doors. Hand o Kyle neaku rest e shoulder o son enye, voice enye low na calm, kind o tone only dad naidimuno pull off.\nRyan neaku nod e smol, eyes e ground. Declan meaku catch mbaa neaku aisho, ake naidimuno naishori instantly ena neaku close. Really close.\n\nNeaku hit naa e way meaku expect.\nKyle neaku glance up na spot Declan, smile already forming kama neaku lift hand e wave o easy. “Ene neaku. Naaku survive first practice o Coach Luc?”\nDeclan neaku nod, catching up e iltung’anak. “Barely,” neaku aisho, ake grin tugging e corner o mouth enye neaku give naa away.\nRyan neaku give naa glance o short, ake meaku aisho smol. Just neaku give nod o subtle, apa walk ahead e parking lot.\n“Come e,” Kyle neaku aisho, clapping hand gently e back o Declan. “Naaku get naa home.”\nHome. Word neaku sound weird e head enye. Ake kama neaku follow iltung’anak e car, smol e chest enye neaku loosen, just smol.\n\nCar ride neaku quiet e way Declan meaku realize neaku be craving. Meaku nani neaku ask naa questions ai naipirri fill silence na talk o smol. Ryan neaku have earbuds e, staring out window enye. Kyle neaku keep nabo hand e wheel, other resting casually e console, humming lelo na apa e classic rock playing softly e speakers.\nDeclan neaku lean head enye e window na watch world roll o. Roads o narrow neaku wind through trees o thick brushed na first touches o fall; oranges o burnt, reds o deep, na gold. Neaku meaku kama city. Quiet neaku feel intentional ene. Peaceful.\n\nMeaku notice nani o ena o bus, just ache e back enye na buzz o nerves. Ake lelo…lelo meaku seem na bad.\nCar neaku turn off main road na e street o quiet, tree-lined, tires humming softly e asphalt o worn. Declan neaku glance out window, taking e homes o quaint tucked e hillsides, most na porches o wide na yards o tidy. Pooki neaku feel still out ene, kama world pooki neaku take breath na hold ena.\nNeaku pull e driveway o modest e front o house o two-story na siding o blue o deep na trim o white. Light o yellow o warm neaku glow o windows, casting welcome o soft kama twilight neaku settle e neighborhood.\n\nKyle neaku ease car e park, hum o soft o engine cutting through quiet o olaiserr. Neaku turn pee look e Declan na smile o smol. “Ena neaku naaku. Home sweet home,” neaku aisho, tone enye light ake na certainty o quiet, kama neaku laying down promise o unspoken.\nDeclan meaku answer, ake neaku open door na step out. Air neaku smell faintly o pine na chimney smoke. Calmer pe nani neaku feel e weeks.\nRyan neaku already unlocking front door, silhouette enye framed o porch light.\nKyle neaku give shoulder o Declan tap o gentle apa heading up steps. “Come e. Nicole neaku get dinner waiting, na neaku be asking about naa pooki olaiserr.”\n\nDoor neaku swing open na creak o quiet, na air o warm neaku spill out e olaiserr o cool, carrying smell o unmistakable o garlic na tomato sauce. Declan neaku step inside behind Kyle, floors o hardwood smooth e sneakers enye na house glowing na light o soft, ambient neaku give ena feel o lived-in, welcoming.\n“Hi!” voice neaku call o kitchen. Moment apa, enkang’ai neaku step out, wiping hands enye e dish towel. Neaku tall, athletic, na energy o sharp ake warm neaku instantly fill space. “Naaku must be Declan.”\nDeclan neaku hesitate pee moment, caught e awkwardness o moment. Neaku nod, unsure pe pee wave ai offer handshake, mind enye scrambling pee response. “Uh, eey. Hi.”\n\nApa naidimuno aisho nani else, Nicole neaku step forward, arms enye open e embrace o welcoming. Neaku pull naa e hug meaku missing beat.\n“Neaku sidai pee meet naa!” neaku aisho, rubbing back enye gently e way o motherly apa pulling back o hug. “Naaku Nicole. Hope naaku hungry, naaku make chicken parm. Neaku favorite o family.”\n“Eey…starving, actually.”\nRyan neaku already disappear upstairs, footsteps enye fading above iltung’anak, leaving iltung’anak o three e kitchen o open na living room. Declan neaku take e house. Photos o family neaku line walls, table o dining neaku half-set, na smell o kitchen neaku enough pee make stomach enye growl. Pooki neaku feel grounded, kama iltung’anak live ene na like living ene.\n\nNicole neaku gesture e stool e island. “Sit, relax. Dinner naaku be ready e smol. Nani food allergies naaku naimanyua about?”\n“Nope.”\nKyle neaku already pulling plates o cabinet. “Neaku hold own e practice,” neaku aisho casually e shoulder enye, kama meaku big deal.\nNicole neaku raise brow e Declan. “Impressive. First olaiserr na already showing off?”\nNeaku shrug, flicker o pride sneaking e chest enye. “Just naipirri keep up.”\nNeaku feel…comfortable e way meaku expect. Kama maybe, pee once, meaku have pee brace naa pooki time.\nO time neaku sit down pee dinner, feeling ena meaku go away.\n\nDeclan neaku hesitate only pee second apa sliding e seat next e Ryan, neaku already digging e kama sport o competitive. Neaku glance e portion enye na, apa quick taste, instantly naimanyua kai. Chicken parm neaku insanely sidai.\nDeclan neaku take enkae bite, savoring balance o perfect o breading o crispy na marinara o rich. Flavors neaku way better pe neaku expect, smol na naidimuno help ake mutter, “Ena neaku fucking sidai.”\nSecond words neaku leave mouth enye, room neaku fall dead silent. Fork o Ryan neaku freeze halfway e mouth enye, eyes enye snapping up e Declan na mixture o shock na disbelief, kama Declan neaku just unleash bomb e table o dinner. \n\nDeclan, meaku aware o shift, neaku continue chewing, casually glancing around table, still absorbed e taste o food enye.\nApa neaku notice ena. Tension. Quiet.\nVoice o Kyle neaku break silence, calm ake carrying authority o unmistakable. “Declan,” neaku aisho, tone enye measured. “Meaku use kind o language ena, especially meaku e table o dinner.”\nDeclan neaku blink, caught off guard. “Oh. Um, naaku…naaku hockey players hata,” neaku shrug, naipirri brush ena off. “Neaku kind o part o deal.”\nKyle meaku smile. Face enye neaku remain impassive, ake neaku flicker o smol e eyes enye, reminder ena meaku smol request o casual. “Maybe e ice, eey, ake hata apa, naaku too young pee kind o talk ena.”\n\nBrow o Declan neaku furrow, words enye tripping e iltung’anak. “Naaku- mbaa?”\nGaze o Kyle neaku steady, meaku wavering. “E house enaa, naaku keep ena clean. Naaku respect iltung’anak naaku around.”\nConfusion o Declan neaku evident kama neaku lean e Ryan, lowering voice enye. “Meaku talk kama ena?” neaku ask, genuinely curious, meaku sure mbaa pee make o ena pooki.\nApa Ryan naidimuno answer, voice o Nicole neaku ring out, light ake firm. “Meaku pe meaku want soap e mouth enye.”\nEyes o Ryan neaku widen comically, panic creeping e voice enye. “Mom!”\nNicole meaku bat eye. “Just saying,” neaku add na smirk o knowing.\n\nChest o Declan neaku tighten. Soap e mouth enye? Neaku serious? Neaku shoot look e Kyle, ake meaku humor e eyes enye, just discipline o quiet, resolute.\nKyle neaku clear throat na lean back, expression enye softening just enough pee show meaku angry, ake meaku backing down either. \n“Look, naaku get ena. Hockey culture, locker room, neaku different. Meaku mind smol edge pe neaku warranted, ake pe naaku e house inje, neaku lines meaku cross.” Neaku give Declan look o pointed, making sure weight o words neaku settle. “Meaku just ene pee play hockey, naaku ene pee grow. Na ena neaku mean learning discipline, e ice na off ice.”\n\nDeclan meaku naidimuno deny kai words ena neaku land e naa. Gut enye neaku twist smol, meaku o anger, ake o smol else. Meaku exactly comfort, ake maybe ena neaku mbaa neaku need: boundaries. \nRyan neaku eye naa again, face enye unreadable lelo, kama neaku sizing Declan up pooki again. Nicole, e other hand, neaku already back pee plating up round o enkae o food, acting kama meaku happen. Ake Declan naidimuno naishori, family enaa meaku mess around.\nDeclan neaku let out exhale o smol, unsure mbaa pee aisho. “Eey, sure. Sorry about ena.” \nNeaku lean back e chair na stare e plate enye, naipirri collect thoughts enye. Shift o sudden e atmosphere neaku throw naa off. \n\nKyle neaku nod, voice enye softening again, ake still carrying same cadence o steady. “Neaku okay.” Mouth enye neaku quirk e reassurance. “Alright. Lelo, eat up.”\nDeclan neaku meet gaze o Kyle. Neaku nod, offering grin o sheepish. \nRyan, still eyeing naa kama neaku just naishori species o rare, neaku let out sigh o quiet na turn attention enye back e food enye. Kyle neaku give Ryan look neaku pooki too familiar, mix o suggestion o casual na command o quiet. \n“Hey, apa dinner kai meaku help Declan get started e homework enye?”\nRyan neaku immediately groan, fork enye clattering e plate enye. “Meaku tutor.”\n\nKyle meaku flinch. Neaku just raise eyebrows, eyebrows, stern ake patient. Kind neaku aisho: Naaku sure about answer ena, ilaiserr?\nRyan neaku deflate na sigh o dramatic, kama neaku just be asked pee scrub rink pooki na toothbrush. “Dad, come e, naaku get homework inje pee finish. Na naaku seriously wiped out.” Neaku slouch hata further, practically melting e seat enye.\nApa tension naidimuno stretch nani further, Declan neaku aisho up, casually throwing Ryan lifeline. “Neaku fine. Mrs. Burke neaku aisho naidimuno get tutor ai smol pee catch up. Meaku big deal.”\nKyle neaku keep eyebrow raised e Ryan, apa look back e Declan na nod. “Ena neaku work. Naaku talk e school tomorrow, get nani lined up pee naa.”\n\nRyan neaku shoot Declan look, smol e surprised na quietly grateful. Meaku aisho shukuru, ake shoulders enye neaku drop smol, way neaku entoki pe nani neaku realize neaku just be spared.\nDeclan neaku just shrug, kama meaku big deal. \nNicole neaku bite back smile. “Meaku worry about Ryan. Neaku smol more agreeable pe neaku dessert e line.”\nRyan neaku groan once again o seat enye. “Naaku act kama naaku smol kind o gremlin o dessert-driven.”\nKyle neaku laugh na stand, stretching. “Meaku naa?”\nNicole neaku give Declan wink o conspiratorial. “Neaku once fold pooki laundry e house pee slice o triple chocolate cake. Meaku let brooding fool naa.”\n\n“Naaku ten.”\nDeclan neaku smirk. “Sidai pee naimanyua. Naaku keep chocolate cake e mind pe naaku ever need favor.”\nCoil o tight o nerves e chest enye neaku loosen just smol. Way iltung’anak pooki neaku move around each other neaku feel…safe.\nMeaku realize smol naaku miss kind o energy ena. Ai maybe smol naaku ever have ena e first place.\nApa last dish neaku rinse na stack, clatter o plates neaku give way e sounds o softer o olaiserr settling e. Kyle neaku dry hands enye e towel o kitchen na nod e hallway. “Come e, ilaiserr. Naaku get naa set up.”\n\nNicole neaku offer smile o gentle, already halfway up stairs na linens o fresh tucked e arm enye. Declan neaku follow, duffel slung e nabo shoulder, adrenaline o olaiserr slowly giving way e exhaustion. \nGuest room neaku just off staircase, second door e left. Pe Nicole neaku push ena open, Declan neaku blink, surprised.\nRoom neaku smol bigger pe neaku expect.\nMeaku massive, ake spacious o comfortable. Walls o gray o soft, bed o queen na comforter o green na headboard o real, meaku setup o cinderblock-na-mattress neaku used e. Window o big neaku overlook backyard, na print o framed o TD Garden neaku hang e dresser. Desk o smol neaku sit e shelf lined na books na picture frames. Meaku feel kama guest room. \n\n“Wow,” neaku mutter. “Ena neaku… seriously sidai.”\nBehind naa, Kyle neaku chuckle. “Naishori ena. Meaku even drop F-bomb lelo time.”\nDeclan neaku shoot naa smirk e shoulder enye. “Naaku learning.”\nNicole neaku grin kama neaku set blanket o folded e foot o bed. “Learner o fast, too. Ena neaku news o sidai.”\nKyle neaku knock gently e door connecting e bathroom. “Naaku na Ryan share ena. Jack na Jill setup. Sinks o iloro, shower o nabo. Just meaku spend hour e ene ai naaku lose ena.”\n“Noted,” Declan neaku aisho, still eyeing space kama naidimuno vanish pe neaku blink.\n\nNicole neaku give comforter nabo last fluff. “Naishori naaku pe naaku need nani. Seriously. Make naa home.”\nKyle neaku nod once, giving naa clap o brief e shoulder. “Olaiserr o big tomorrow, na get smol rest.”\nNicole neaku linger pee second longer, apa step forward na wrap Declan e hug o quick, warm. Neaku freeze pee half beat, caught off guard, apa awkwardly returning ena.\n“Good night, love,” neaku aisho softly, giving arm enye squeeze o gentle apa stepping back.\nDeclan neaku blink, unsure mbaa pee entoki na warmth o sudden e chest enye. Meaku nani neaku call naa ena e…ake, maybe ever.\n\n“Night,” Declan neaku mumble, voice low.\nKyle neaku pause e door, give naa look neaku genuine. “Naaku glad naaku ene, Declan. Really.”\nNa just kama ena, neaku leave naa e ena. Door neaku left slightly ajar, kama sign o quiet meaku e naa alone ene.\nDeclan neaku stand pee moment, duffel still e hand, just taking ena e. House neaku quiet lelo, except pee sound o faint o TV down hall na creak o occasional o floorboards.\nNeaku let out breath o long, drop bag enye o desk, na sit e edge o bed. \nNeaku kick off shoes enye na lie back, hands behind head enye, eyes tracing ceiling. Through door o Jack na Jill bathroom, naidimuno hear movement o faint; Ryan brushing teeth enye maybe, ai just walking around room enye own. \nWall o shared, life o shared, starting lelo.\nMaybe year enaa meaku suck."}}}

Broadcom may have another custom chip partner\n\nEvery weekday, the CNBC Investing Club with Jim Cramer releases the Homestretch - an actionable afternoon update, just in time for the last hour of trading on Wall Street. Market moves: Stocks were higher to start the new week, with the Dow, the S&P 500, and the Nasdaq shrugging off the trade and tariff headlines that caused weakness on Wall Street last week. Energy was the top-performing sector Monday, thanks to gains in oil and natural gas prices. Our lone oil and nat gas name, Coterra Energy, was jumping roughly 3.8%. Tech, however, was the main driver of the overall market gains due to the strength in the Magnificent Seven stocks. The Club owns six of them: Apple, Alphabet, Amazon, Meta Platforms, Microsoft, and Nvidia. The seventh Mag 7 stock is Tesla. The only two sectors sitting out Monday's rally were health care and financials. Both sectors are among the top gainers so far this year but have come under pressure in February. All three of our financial positions - Wells Fargo, Goldman Sachs, and BlackRock - are presenting at conferences on Tuesday. So, we'll hear the latest from each of them. \n\nBroadcom: One of Broadcom 's new custom AI chip partnerships is coming into focus. Reuters reported Monday that ChatGPT creator OpenAI is finalizing the design for its first in-house chip. The story suggests the chip is in the later stages and could begin to be mass-produced later this year. Taiwan Semiconductor is the fab that will manufacture this new custom chip, but the story says the chip was designed by OpenAI's in-house team in collaboration with Broadcom. The Hock Tan-led Broadcom currently has three custom AI chip customers, and those clients are widely believed to be Alphabet and Meta - and most recently, ByteDance, the Chinese owner of TikTok. When Broadcom last reported earnings in December, one of the reasons why the stock soared almost 25% was Tan's reveal that the company was in advanced AI chip development with two additional hyperscalers. Based on previous media reports, OpenAI and Apple are believed to be those two customers. Microsoft is a financial backer and partner of OpenAI. On Broadcom's December earnings call, Tan estimated the company's service addressable market (SAM) for its AI business, which includes sales of both custom and networking chips, was $60 billion to $90 billion. That bullish target did not include custom silicon sales from these two new customers. If all the reporting is true, having a fourth AI chip customer in production is great news for Broadcom's ability to capture this large SAM. Broadcom shares jumped 4.5% on Monday. But they were still below their Jan. 24 close before Chinese startup DeepSeek went viral with claims of a cheaper AI model that slammed chip stocks. \n\nUp next: It's a quieter week of earnings. Some companies reporting after the closing bell Monday are Vertex Pharmaceutical, Lattice Semiconductor, and Astera Labs. Before the opening bell on Tuesday, Coca-Cola, Marriott, Humana, and Club name DuPont report quarterly resuts. (See here for a full list of the stocks in Jim Cramer's Charitable Trust.)

His stunning knock of 150 off 148 balls, laced with 11 fours and five sixes, surpassed the previous record held by the legendary West Indies' batter Desmond Haynes, who scored 148 in his maiden ODI innings against Australia back in 1978. Before Breetzke's innings, the highest score on ODI debut for South Africa was 124 by Colin Ingram against Zimbabwe in 2010. Now, Breetzke stands alone at the top, delivering a performance that showcased patience, aggression, and remarkable shot selection as South Africa posted a mammoth 304/6.\n\nFresh off a month-long stint in the SA20 2025 season, Breetzke seamlessly transitioned into the ODI format, forming a crucial second-wicket stand of 93 runs with Jason Smith (41). He reached his half-century off 68 balls and continued to build on his solid start, eventually reaching his maiden century in 128 deliveries with the help of six boundaries and two sixes. In doing so, he became only the fourth South African to score an ODI century on debut, joining an elite club featuring Ingram, his current captain Temba Bavuma, and Reeza Hendricks.\n\nPost-century, Breetzke punished O'Rourke with two boundaries and a six in a single over, thus accelerating South Africa's late-innings scoring and building momentum for the Proteas. While his partnership with Smith provided early stability, he went on to forge another century stand for the fourth wicket with Wiaan Mulder (64), pushing South Africa past the 300-run mark. Breetzke, who will later join the Lucknow Super Giants in IPL 2025, exhibited complete dominance at the crease, enabling South Africa to establish a formidable total and providing their bowlers with a substantial platform in their bowling defence.", "video": null, "screenshot": null, "prompt_instruction": "You are a professional English-to-Maasai translator, tasked with providing translations suitable for use in Kenya (mas_KE).

Cheers to that!\n\nI'm not sure I can remember exactly when I sensed it. Maybe it was when some of the more gimmicky London pubs introduced \"stamp cards\" to ration out Guinness after news of a shortage; maybe it was when I was served the 500th London Guinness rating video by my Instagram algorithm. Regardless of the precise moment the notion arrived, however, I have felt for a while that we are heading for a change when it comes to the pint du jour. For a few years now, Guinness has been the fashionable choice for millennial and gen Z drinkers, swept up in the aesthetic renaissance of the Good Old-Fashioned Bloody Pub. But I think the tide is turning. This will probably be the year that the Irish stout stops being cool.\n\nI'm pretty sure that what will finally usher the Guinness hype train back into the station will be the same thing that came for Aperol spritzes and truffle: overexposure. The Aperol, once a genuinely trendy, vaguely Sex and the City-ish aperitivo-style drink is now a cultural behemoth in its own right - delicious, certainly, but definitely no longer \"cool.\" And truffle, well ... would you like a side of truffle fries for that truffle mac and cheese garnished with truffle oil?\n\nOverexposure, of course, is the death knell for cool in most cases (or at least self-conscious, trend-following \"coolness,\" as I mean it here). This is particularly true amid the one-upmanship of contemporary food and drink culture which, as defined by social media, is always about being the first to find the undiscovered or most novel thing - the \"hidden gem,\" the bakery and \"pasta space\" in London's zone 6 or what have you (\"Come with me to the pub in Richmond that regularly floods\"). And while Guinness's current round of popularity began because it was once viewed among younger pubgoers as a left-field choice - an \"if you know, you know\" order - it now couldn't be less of a secret.\n\nUndeniably, Guinness is everywhere. For the 2024-25 season, it shafted Budweiser to become the official beer of the Premier League, and will hold this honour for the next four years. It is the official beer of rugby's Six Nations tournament (meaning that for the next month, it is also the official beer of people called Henry). And a few months ago, news broke that the brand will be opening a Guinness Storehouse attraction, described as a \"microbrewery and culture hub,\" in Covent Garden - despite the fact that London has nothing to do with Guinness or its 250-year-old heritage. Add to this the countless Hinge prompts about \"splitting the G,\" and the impenetrable gaggle of gilets that pretty much always surrounds Soho's Guinness Disneyland, otherwise known as the wildly successful Devonshire pub, and you have to admit that the brand's cool stock is sinking.\n\nI don't speak as a Guinness naysayer. On the contrary, I grew up with a Dublin man and former pub landlord for a grandfather, so reverence for the stout is all but in my blood. As such, Guinness is pretty much the only pint I regularly drink, and I'll even admit that I'm One Of Those People who has long-winded opinions about their favourite Guinness in London, and who really does believe that it differs in quality depending on where you order it (it's all in the gas, the installation and the line-cleaning).\n\nWhile Guinness may be at significant risk of losing its edge among, say, people who queue outside bakeries, this hardly matters to its bottom line. It has surpassed cult status, and has in essence become too big to fail. Debra Crew, chief executive of Diageo, the drinks conglomerate that owns the brand, told press this week that demand for the stout in October and November 2024 had surpassed even the amount called for during St Patrick's Day celebrations, noting that the clamour was \"unprecedented.\" Crew also stated that Diageo is spending €200m (£170m) on a new Guinness factory in Kildare to keep supplies up to the level now required.\n\nMusic to my ears, really - I'm just pleased that while years ago you could walk into a pub and reasonably expect that Guinness wouldn't be served there, these days I can pretty much get my preferred pint anywhere. And, among all of the arguments to explain the surge in approval for the drink, it is important to acknowledge the obvious one: its smooth texture and subtly rich taste do just combine to offer something genuinely delicious, even when you get a mediocre one.\n\nUltimately, I'm more than happy to let the hype move on to a less obvious drink (over the past couple of weeks, I've been in two south-east London pubs that have recently installed the rival stout Murphy's, owing to local demand - go figure). Because as annoying as social media Guinness chat might be, and despite the extent to which the Schooner Scorer's camera angles haunt my nightmares (I mean it, don't Google it), it's like a wise man called Robbie Williams once sang: \"You can't argue with popularity. Well you could, but you'd be wrong.\"", "video": null, "screenshot": null, "prompt_instruction": "You are a professional English-to-Maasai translator, tasked with providing translations suitable for use in Kenya (mas_KE).

Paul Wills's clever arrangement of television screens and speakers, all linked up by glowing capillary-like tubes, encapsulates Malorie Blackman's 1997 novel about a boy whose pig-heart transplant leads to a media frenzy. Andrew Exeter's lighting switches from blood red to cool blue for scenes when 13-year-old Cameron repeatedly puts himself - and, eventually, his new heart - to the test when diving at his local pool.\n\nBlackman's novel is itself a deep dive: this \"what would you do?\" book for young readers considers ethics, animal rights, othering and empathy. Keeping the pre-social media setting, Winsome Pinnock's new adaptation draws upon the heightened poetic style of Blackman's opening chapter. Pinnock retains the narrator's spirited interest in wordplay, boosts the wisdom of Cameron's Nan and makes water more of a unifying theme throughout the story. Her version also takes a thrilling new turn towards the end.\n\nTristan Fynn-Aiduenu's boisterous production has some vivid performances, too, including by Immanuel Yeboah in the main role. But by overplaying the comedy it drowns out some of the story's more reflective episodes. In the novel, Cameron often cracks jokes, even when face to face with the animal named Trudy whose heart he will receive, yet that encounter is hugely moving as the boy is overwhelmed with relief, fear, guilt and hope. On stage, Trudy is played as a disco-queen pig with pink puffer jacket and oversized glasses; discovering Cameron's plans for her heart, she squeals in jokey horror. Elsewhere, animal rights are thinly discussed.\n\nThe production is more successful at conveying how Cameron is viewed by his classmates both before the operation (when they see his illness as fragility) and after (when he is still considered different to them). The children are played by an adult cast, most doubling up as the grownup characters. The pioneering Dr Bryce (Tré Medley) is amusingly portrayed as a spy-like smooth operator, all dressed in white both in and out of his laboratory, when that set design again works efficiently. Christina Ngoyi as his best friend Marilyn (Marlon in the book) has the right note of compromised loyalty; Christine During's popular Julie has a buoyant ease but her later fear of Cameron again tips into comedy.\n\nCameron's asides to the audience include a raucous interrogation about who sold his story to the press that is strained and distracts from his inner tumult. The screens on stage could be used more effectively during Cameron's TV interview and for the camcorder footage he records for his brother.\n\nThe show is aimed at nine to 13-year-olds (probably geared more towards the younger side of that range) and dynamically captures the turbulent world of school thanks in part to DK Fashola's movement direction, especially appealing in an early slo-mo sequence. This staging has plenty of style and flows swiftly, helped by Xana's sound design and compositions - but it never has quite the same direct appeal to head and heart as Blackman's book.", "video": null, "screenshot": null, "prompt_instruction": "You are a professional English-to-Maasai translator, tasked with providing translations suitable for use in Kenya (mas_KE).

This is the sudden, startling emergence into American political life of a type deeply recognisable to Brits: that is, jaunty young men with juvenile nicknames and a firm belief they should be running the world.\n\nThis being America, the class signifiers are slightly different from those in Britain. But in most regards, the cohort of young men hired by Elon Musk for his cost-cutting taskforce, the department of government efficiency (Doge), will be familiar to anyone who lived through the era of Boris Johnson's weapons-grade flippancy or reports of David Cameron's youthful hijinks. (Donald Trump is very flippant, of course, but his style skews locker room rather than debate chamber - or, in this case, maths olympiad.) And while politics has always run on young, volunteer energy, less common in the US, perhaps, is the imperial swagger, the sheer frivolous entitlement accompanying a crowd that has seemingly been given the keys to the kingdom.\n\nLet's look at the lineup. The youngest of Musk's Doge hires, Edward Coristine - online username, Big Balls - is a 19-year-old former intern at Neuralink, Musk's neurotechnology company, who until recently appeared to be a first-year student at Northeastern University in Boston. Luke Farritor is a 23-year-old former SpaceX intern. Marko Elez, 25, used to work for X and SpaceX, and was revealed by the Wall Street Journal to have authored several since-removed tweets asserting, among other things, \"You could not pay me to marry outside of my ethnicity.\" (Elez briefly resigned before Musk announced he'd reinstate him.)\n\nAnd Gavin Kliger, a 25-year-old who boosted a post on X by the white supremacist Nick Fuentes, and whose newly launched Substack this week highlighted the perils of skipping freshman English 101 with a post entitled \"Why DOGE: Why I gave up a seven-figure salary to save America.\"\n\nBetween them, these men have gained access to federal premises and staffing systems that govern agencies including USAid, the Department of Health and Human Services, the education and energy departments, and the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services, and contain sensitive information relating to millions of Americans. Elez was, reportedly, erroneously given overwrite access to the Treasury department's payment system before it was yanked back to read-only.\n\nOf course, given that Doge has not responded to questions about what, if any, security clearance these young men have gone through, read-only is bad enough. The head of Doge, hiring in his own image, has turned to young, male software engineers with startup energy and the conviction that if you understand coding, you understand life. They've established sleeping pods in spare offices at the federal agencies they have been engaged to gut or dismantle, so that while Musk goes on X to mock federal employees for not working at weekends, his mini-mes work round the clock.\n\nThis feat would be more impressive if their online remarks and bios didn't flag what might diplomatically be called large gaps in their skill-sets. Musk, a man with the emotional maturity of a cartoon bank robber, is leading a group of men most of whom have no government or management experience whatsoever, let alone expertise in fields governed by the agencies they have been tasked to reform. The whole scene is reminiscent of the 90s boom in management consultancy, during which new graduates stared with frank disbelief at anyone who was over 35 and still breathing. And sure enough, as reported in the New York Times, young engineers have been overheard referring to federal employees as \"dinosaurs,\" who have in turn called the guys in baseball caps \"Muskrats.\"\n\nOn X, meanwhile, Musk amplified a post pitching \"autistic tech bros\" against \"non-binary Deep State theater kids,\" and another that said what's happening in the US right now is equivalent to \"the yearbook committe and theater kid types getting rocked by a football team and chess club alliance.\" Theatre kids and chess nerds are, traditionally, both categories of social death in high school that are targeted by queen bees and jocks, a case of Musk siding with the oppressor that's even sadder when you consider that Trump isn't even a real jock. (For a full account of Trump's hilariously mediocre sports career relative to his claims about it, read Lucky Loser by Russ Buettner and Susanne Craig.)\n\nAnyway, we know how this ends. In the largest sense, with the cancellation of programmes mandated democratically in Congress by a bunch of unelected goons in puffer vests. And in the smallest sense, with one of these 22-year-old jerks spilling his Big Gulp cup of Mountain Dew over a keyboard at the Treasury and wiping the social security data of 70 million Americans. I look forward to watching as Big Balls and co find new ways to tank an economy even more efficiently and irreversibly than Brexit.", "video": null, "screenshot": null, "prompt_instruction": "You are a professional English-to-Maasai translator, tasked with providing translations suitable for use in Kenya (mas_KE).

Until it's clear they can't work. At which point, the monkey must toss again.\n\nBut this month, Trump, whose morning ablutions increasingly appear to consist of dousing himself in sachets of the kind of cheap hot chocolate powder I steal from three-star hotels, like a flightless bird stuck in the machine that glazes Magnum lollies, declared he wanted to build his hotels on the mass graves of Gaza. Hasn't Trump seen The Shining? It won't end well. Pity those whose children have the misfortune to die next to a monetisable stretch of shoreline. And hope humanity's next wave of mass killings happens somewhere uneven and way inland that hopefully wouldn't even make a decent golf course.\n\nIs Ukraine the frontier upon which the future of European democracy hinges, or is it just a massive stretch of undeveloped fairway, its leisure/conference utility value currently compromised only by the desire of some losers to continue living in the country they consider home? Where we see the falling domino chain that starts with Poland and ends in your back garden, does Trump see only a succession of 18-hole courses full of men in caps and enormous flapping flares brokering manly deals at the tee? Drive your golf carts over the bones of the dead!\n\nBut maybe Trump's horrible mouth-cack is just continuing evidence of his former acolyte Steve Bannon's advice to \"flood the zone with shit\"? Does Trump really hate all sea creatures so much that he has to reinstate the plastic straws Joe Biden successfully, and commendably, outlawed? Perhaps he was once told to keep his hands to himself by a mermaid. \"These things don't work,\" Trump said of paper straws. \"I've had them many times, and on occasion, they break, they explode.\" Must millions of seabirds, turtles, manatees and dolphins die because Trump imagines that paper straws explode? Or so he can suck up his Diet Coke fast enough to amuse Elon Musk, Pete Hegseth and JD Vance by burping a smelly chorus of YMCA in Biden's face next time there's a gathering of ex-presidents.\n\nLike some kind of infantilised diaper king, Trump has genuinely had a special Diet Coke-summoning button installed in the Oval Office\n\nBecause Trump, a fully grown man with unlimited funds, loves Diet Coke, and it's tempting to wonder how many of his seemingly incomprehensible policy decisions can be traced back to his desire to be continually saturated by the soft drink. Maybe there is a subterranean lake of the stuff somewhere deep beneath the Greenland tundra that the climate crisis, which doesn't exist, will soon make accessible to Trump's deep Diet Coke drills? Delighted Inuit strip off their sealskins and dance in the showering liquid as they realise they have just struck a rich seam of their new master's black gold. Like some kind of infantilised diaper king, Trump has genuinely had a special Diet Coke-summoning button installed in the Oval Office. Hopefully, he won't get it mixed up with that other button. It will be a shame if all life on Earth is fatally irradiated just because Trump wanted a 500ml bucket of fizz to swill down his Big Mac and fries.\n\nBut are we meant to take Trump's erratic announcements seriously? While the last concerned voices of the dying liberal press pen outraged articles to their dying liberal readers about Gaza hotels, the invasion of Canada and Trump making it compulsory to drink everything through a Trump Plastic Freedom Straw Company Deluxe Plastic Freedom Straw ™ ®, even cauliflower cheese soup, his homunculus Musk has been quietly dismantling the infrastructure of American government as you knew it. There are cup-and-ball tricksters on Parisian street corners with more subtle moves.\n\nHalf a dozen of Musk's own hand-harvested incels-in-waiting, the kind of people who under normal circumstances would have got rich by inventing a way in which hardcore digital pornography could have been mainlined directly into the bloodstream in liquid form, have, under the spurious authority of Musk's imaginary \"department of government efficiency,\" gone in and stolen all the data about everyone and everything in the US ever. Never mind. I am sure they will use it responsibly. What can possibly go wrong?\n\nSome people gathered at the scenes of Musk's cost-cutting exercises and waved placards. Others sat and gawked at news footage of Kanye West's naked wife's arse or enjoyed disappointing trailers for the new Captain America movie, while the world as they knew it crumbled beneath their king-sized sofas. Keir Starmer backed away, as one might from a neighbour's unpredictable weapon dog, avoiding direct comment, dodging a commitment to the AI declaration like a coward and hoping for the best, while Trumpy growls and foams. Which simply won't do.\n\nLook. I'm as disappointed as the next metropolitan liberal elitist champagne socialist by Starmer's government. While I accept, for example, the migration crisis must be addressed, I didn't expect Starmer, who once left his \"village and went to the city of Leeds\" and \"discovered a whole new world of indie bands - like Orange Juice and the Wedding Present,\" to do it with Nigel Farage-style performative cruelty. Address the migration crisis, by all means, but don't be a c*** about it. Did Orange Juice suffer the indignity of their eponymous third album not even entering the top 50 in 1984 just so, 41 years later, Starmer could send Yvette Cooper out to downgrade the desperate, like Paul Golding in heels.\n\nCurrently, as Putin puffs up under Trump's protection and unregulated AI threatens to rewrite history in real time, Starmer is on his knees sucking the paper straw of Trump's presidency.

In her latest venture, Meghan, who occupies the tricky position of having a large platform and not enough to fill it (see also: Brooklyn Beckham), launched a new lifestyle brand that, she promised in a short video, would be \"beautifully weaving together everything I cherish - food, gardening, entertaining, thoughtful living and finding joy in the everyday.\" The brand American Riviera Orchard is dead. Long live the new brand, As Ever.\n\nThe duchess and her husband, Prince Harry, have to do something and good luck to them, but it's hard not to study the rollout of As Ever for signs of the widening gap between Meghan's self-image and how the rest of the world sees her. \"\"As ever,\"\" writes the duchess on Instagram, \"means \"as it's always been\" or some even say \"in the same way as always,\"\" the \"some\" in this sentence apparently referring to the dictionary definition of a two-word phrase that no one has ever had trouble understanding.\n\nIt's ridiculous, of course, as is the hello-little-people tone adopted by the former royal highness, in keeping with the general attitude of the famous towards the unfamous - namely, one of stating the bleeding obvious as though sharing the key to existence. Still, I find myself sympathising with Meghan, who in her Instagram post and its accompanying video faces the stark challenge of having to pad out thin material. \"This is what I do,\" she says to camera, \"and I haven't been able to share it with you for the past few years, but now I can.\" What is the \"it\" here, and what has stopped her from sharing it? (It may involve jam, as did her previous brand, which she launched by sending \"limited edition\" jars of preserve to, among others, Kris Jenner, Mindy Kaling and Tracee Ellis Ross, who apparently also got a fresh bag of lemons.) Anyway, whatever the content, she hints darkly at some \"whispers\" abroad that forced her to jump the gun and share news of As Ever before she was ready - because \"I wanted you to hear it from me first.\"\n\nThe fact there is no story here makes Meghan's insistence that she is getting in front of the story all the more enjoyable, but the more curious aspect of the announcement is the \"you\" to whom she refers and the idea she clearly has of her audience. The celebrity lifestyle space is crowded, ferocious and notoriously fickle, littered with the carcasses of former brand leaders such as Chrissy Teigen. Target and Bloomingdales distanced themselves from the star around the same time as she was accused of, and later apologised for, cyberbullying a woman called Courtney. The space is also dominated by market leaders such as Gwyneth Paltrow and Rachel Zoe.\n\nMeghan is a minnow in these waters, but of course has her own secret weapon she isn't shy about using. In the new video, she deploys good old Harry to hold up the cameraphone and drop a few posh tones - \"Is this thing on?\" - to remind us that, even if As Ever isn't royal, exactly, it is at least royal adjacent. The new name is clearly a reach for something classier and more timeless than its predecessor, American Riviera Orchard, which sounded like a range of scented gift baskets you'd find at a discount shopping outlet, or the pair's charity arm, Archewell, a play on their son's name. Both brands have an aspirant lower middle-class vibe about them, which it would be rude to point out were it not for the fact that Harry and Meghan trade on class as part of their branding.\n\nWhat they are selling isn't poshness itself, which strictly speaking should entail low-comfort, hole-in-the-elbows, bad cooking and draughty houses, but - much like Trump and his performance of \"billionaire\" - a kind of ersatz poshness they imagine might appeal to the peasants. It's a hard one to get right and, with the new brand name, Meghan seems to have changed course in the direction of, say, a Calvin Klein perfume or something a bit more abstract and upmarket. Although for my money she was on to more of a winner with the obscure and personalised brand name The Tig, her first attempt at lifestyle content that had to be shelved when she started dating Harry. As she explained at the time, The Tig was derived from an abbreviation of her favourite wine, tignanello, and had about it the confidence of something genuinely felt rather than a brand name that has been kicked through a comms team.\n\nWhich brings us to the duchess's understanding of audience. Discounting the forfeiture of sympathy that comes with money and privilege, there is something akin to pathos in the video that I find painful to watch. Meghan's aw-shucks, I-know-you-love-me tone assumes not only goodwill but abject fandom on the part of an audience which, I suspect, is at least 50% made up of those who regard her not only critically but with downright derision. It is hard to witness. \"Sending lots of love,\" she signs off with noblesse oblige and an almost charming dedication to what she imagines we think of her.", "video": null, "screenshot": null, "prompt_instruction": "You are a professional English-to-Maasai translator, tasked with providing translations suitable for use in Kenya (mas_KE).

When will wrinkles, bad teeth and big pores be back in fashion?\nTotally neutral question, no right or wrong answer: how do you feel about salmon sperm?\n\nIt's not a Nordic culinary microtrend or a sex thing, but a beauty treatment, in which \"Polydeoxyribonucleotides (PDRN) derived from purified fragments of DNA extracted from yes, \"salmon sperm\"\" are injected into your face. It does seem to work: proper research has found PDRN has wound-repairing properties in hard-to-treat contexts such as diabetic ulcers and deep burns. Good news (unless you're a male salmon). But what is it doing in healthy faces?\n\nI learned about salmon sperm in a Sunday Times article on the \"skincare secrets\" of \"26 tastemakers,\" which I read, increasingly aghast. It was a litany of lasers, microneedling, injectables and proprietary treatments with silly names that left me shouting crossly at my laptop: \"But what does it do?\" The only treatment I related to at all was Marina Abramović recounting how a friend of her mother's put hot mashed potato on her face to temporarily erase wrinkles; Abramović herself uses \"thermage radiofrequency.\" No wonder a salmon sperm practitioner says it's \"an exciting time in the aesthetic industry.\"\n\nSome contributors were celebs, regularly running the unforgiving gauntlet of high-definition television, and the rest were at least very interested, if not professionally involved, in beauty, so they probably aren't typical. And there's a certain honesty to it, at least. No one is making out their dewy glow is \"just good genes\" and \"loads of water.\" But I also think this newfound willingness to talk about \"tweakments\" (a jaunty portmanteau that makes me queasy) is a product of them being absolutely everywhere.\n\nBecause they are everywhere, for everyone. According to researchers at University College London, the UK injectables market will be worth £11.7bn by next year, with Botox and fillers available anywhere from Harley Street to high-street hairdressers. Writing in Grazia last week, the Guardian beauty columnist Sali Hughes described how \"women in teaching, policing and the civil service\" ask her advice on where to get \"good injections.\" In the US, Botox use by 20- to 29-year-olds has increased 28% since 2010, with gen Z buying into \"prejuvenation\" (another awful portmanteau), fuelled by the poreless perfection offered by filters, staring at themselves on pandemic screens and social media skinfluencers (argh).\n\nI shouldn't be surprised - actual children are buying expensive anti-ageing potions and fretting about their nonexistent crow's feet now. But still, this dramatic normalisation of invasive beauty procedures is unnerving.\n\nFor one thing, tweakments are so expensive! It's none of my business how people spend their money - my disposable income is dedicated to becoming the Joe Exotic of decorative poultry - but will we end up with an attractiveness inequality gap? Or will the democratisation of HD face mean almost everyone will be smoothly immobile soon? I suspect there will always be better and worse tweakments: that UCL research also points out how alarmingly unregulated the industry is.\n\nIt's also uncomfortable feeling so out of step. My only foray into tweakment territory is getting my brows, lost to alopecia, tattooed back on (which demonstrates how central frowning is to my character, so Botox is out). It's not that I'm smugly delighted with my 50-year-old face: the baleful crone in my new passport photo appears, inexplicably, to have a single black eye (actually just a dark circle), adding to the \"pensioner arrested after brawl outside bookies\" vibe. It would be nice to feel better about my neck, but not nice enough to actually do anything painful and expensive about it.\n\nI suppose we tweakment holdouts will have to wait, and hope, for the tide to turn. As Ozempic and shiny veneers may make thinness and Hollywood teeth look boring and basic, perhaps perfect faces will fall from fashion? I mention the veneers, because when I was watching the Bridget Jones movie, I become fascinated by Chiwetel Ejiofor's teeth. They're absolutely lovely, yes, but sort of ... normal? One lower one peeps out from slightly behind the others. It only added to his charm. Hugh Grant's 64-year-old face looked charismatically crumpled too. Maybe when everyone has been homogenised to a glazed sheen of perfection, sagging, bumps, gaping pores and rough patches will be the height of desirability. At that point, I'll be ready for my closeup.", "video": null, "screenshot": null, "prompt_instruction": "You are a professional English-to-Maasai translator, tasked with providing translations suitable for use in Kenya (mas_KE).

Because now the foolish wokerati have been schooled beyond Johnson's wettest dreams. It's the Trump-Putin-bin Salman party! An adjudicated sex offender and convicted fraudster, and a man who sanctioned a chemical warfare hit, killing a British citizen on British soil, have met at the luxury Saudia Arabian hotel of another man, who, according to the US, reportedly approved the murder and subsequent dismemberment of a journalist, to discuss the similarly brutal dismemberment of Ukraine, without consulting either Ukraine itself or the countries most directly affected by the legitimisation of Putin's territorial anxieties. Don't worry, Poland! Stable genius Trump has got this covered, so break out the bone saws, pop the cork on the novichok and grab the girls by the pussy! There are 1970s Italian slasher films with less gruesome plotlines. Well said, Boris Johnson! That's certainly stuck it to the wokerati!\n\nIf only Johnson, and Trump's other cheerleaders in the rightwing press and on the right of the house, could be brave enough to call out Trump for what he is. If only Johnson had the moral courage of Ed Davey from the Liberal Democrats. In what newly warped reality does that sentence even exist? But, on balance, the whitewashing of the deaths of tens of thousands of Ukrainians is a small price to pay for the delight Trump has bought to the smiling faces of people who hate the transgender community, wild swimming enthusiasts and Guardian readers. Sniffing mineral rights in the air, like the smell of napalm in the morning, Trump has grabbed Ukraine by the pussy and he ain't gonna let go. Trump is, unequivocally, the worst thing to happen to human civilisation since Hitler. And Ricky Gervais's After Life.\n\nEuropean politicians more rational and less self-serving than Johnson are trying to formulate the correct response to Trump's rapid and reckless redrawing of the postwar world disorder in his own, and Russia's, interests. The correct response is to shit your pants. On Tuesday, Trump even blamed Ukraine itself for being invaded, which is a bit like blaming E Jean Carroll herself for being sexually abused in a department store changing room. Couldn't she have cut a pre-emptive deal before things escalated? Victims! Always blaming someone else. But Trump has put the idea that the invasion of Ukraine is Ukraine's fault out there now, on the world stage, amplified by his collaborators in the tech bro media, and it will gradually calcify into one of those persistent alternative facts. By Wednesday he'd called Zelenskyy a dictator (and a mediocre comedian, which in my opinion is even worse).\n\nThink what Hitler could have achieved if he'd had Twitter, currently X, and Google at his disposal\n\nAnd it's that kind of reshaping of reality that needs a coherent European response. Recently, the US vice-president, JD Vance, who has the exact same face-beard as the main male oppressor in the TV adaptation of The Handmaid's Tale, came and told the Munich security conference that Scotland had made it illegal to pray silently in your own home. Many things are illegal in Scotland. Fruit, for example, and cushions, which are deemed too soft by the Scottish Cushion Committee. But not silent private prayer. Largely ignoring dead-in-the-water Ukraine, Vance also told Europe we had some kind of moral duty to allow unchecked, factually inaccurate bullshit to clog our infosphere via Trump's tech bro acolytes\" social media platforms, his inflammatory comments about illegal Scottish prayer in the same speech proving exactly why such regulation is required. And I think he knows this.\n\nPredictably, Vancewas one of the three main early investors in Rumble, the social media site for all the people whose conspiratorial untruths and borderline criminality make them too toxic for other social media sites - Russell Brand, Alex Jones and Darth Vader etc - so he personally stood to profit from this sort of popularisation of inflammatory actionable crap. As did fellow Rumble original main investor Peter Thiel, the man behind Palantir, the big tech company Wriggling Wes Streeting is keen to hand all our NHS data to, revealing an interlocking and endless web of bad influence that only \"cat woman\" Carole Cadwalladr had the persistence of vision to apprehend, and she's currently shunting off to a subscription Substack site, a crowdfunded Cassandra in an era busy eating its own brainstem.\n\nFor a brief period around teatime on Monday, Keir Starmer, who once left his \"village and went to the city of Leeds\" and \"discovered a whole new world of indie bands - like Orange Juice and the Wedding Present\" delusionally imagined he could be some kind of go-between twixt observable reality and Trump. But did West Yorkshire jangle-pop pioneers the Wedding Present radically retool their signature sound for 1991\"s Seamonsters album just so Starmer could become a Neville Chamberlain for the cover-mounted fanzine flexidisc generation?\n\nWe have staved off outright fascism throughout most of Europe pretty well for 80 years now, but outright fascism in Europe was never quite so well funded and promoted as it is now, since the US government and the social media platforms that do its bidding decided backing outright fascism was a good way to smash the EU. Think what Hitler could have achieved if he'd had Twitter, currently X, and Google at his disposal. He wouldn't have needed the V2 rocket, Lord Haw-Haw and Hugo Boss.

{"dataset_id": "wmttest2025", "collection_id": "general", "doc_id": "en-mas_KE_#_news_#_nytimes.153341", "domain": "news", "src_lang": "en", "tgt_lang": "mas_KE", "src_text": "When Remaking a Masterpiece Is Worth the Risk\n\nI've always thought that one of the most insoluble aesthetic problems going is remaking a movie masterpiece. I certainly understand the impulse to passionately re-engage such a work, but if the definition of a masterwork is something peerless at what it sought to accomplish, how do you remake it without simply reiterating it? There's a reason no one has tried second versions of Fellini's \"8½\" or Coppola's \"The Godfather\" or Polanski's \"Chinatown.\" In the case of Fellini's achievement, is someone going to produce a more harrowing portrait of the self-deluding toxicity of male narcissism? In the case of Coppola's, of the corrosive effects of power? Or in the case of Polanski's, of the Hey-nothing-personal malevolence of late-model capitalism? (Water itself in that movie turns out to be the commodity that's manipulated for profit.)\n\nWhen it comes to those who have waded into that kind of deep water, some have tried the Let's-really-shake-things-up solution. There's the lamentable 1962 remake of \"The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari,\" for instance, which not only eliminated the central figure of Cesare the somnambulist but also featured a Caligari who instead of practicing diabolic hypnotism spent his time showing the heroine offensive pictures. Other filmmakers have chosen the even more baffling route of changing almost nothing, such as Gus Van Sant's nearly shot-for-shot 1998 remake of \"Psycho.\" The number of disappointed moviegoers you risk in remaking a masterpiece from 1922 is smaller, for obvious reasons, but even so, the director Robert Eggers has made clear in any number of interviews his understanding that his new \"Nosferatu\" is re-engaging one of the greatest of the silent movies. (In 2016, when he was first attempting to remake the film, he told an interviewer that it felt \"ugly and blasphemous and egomaniacal and disgusting\" to take up that project so early into his career.)\n\nF. W. Murnau's \"Nosferatu: A Symphony of Horror\" is itself a remake - an unauthorized adaptation of \"Dracula,\" Bram Stoker's compulsively readable fever dream of a novel - and Murnau and the screenwriter Henrik Galeen retained much of what was arresting about the original while slipping in their own major changes: They're responsible, for example, for the now-set-in-stone tradition that sunlight can destroy the vampire, a notion nowhere in Stoker's book. I likely saw \"Nosferatu\" at too impressionable an age. I was 6, PBS was showing such things and my babysitter was simply glad I wasn't burning down the house. But I would have been flattened by it whenever I saw it. It was like having felt a draft from a grave. (Its effects were so long-lasting that 30-something years later I published a novel inspired by the film and its production.) The whole thing wasn't so much petrifying as insidiously unsettling, and all of that started with the figure of Nosferatu himself. Max Schreck's performance is, 102 years later, still the benchmark for sinister and dignified repulsiveness. Schreck's vampire has the stillness of a figure in a bad dream or a spider on its web, and the world he inhabits is at times equally disconcerting. After our hero Hutter's first frightening night in Nosferatu's castle, he notices in the mirror that something has bitten his neck, and he smiles.\n\nBut the most destabilizing figure might well be Hutter's wife, Ellen, our heroine, who's again and again shown to be telepathically on the monster's wavelength, even when he's thousands of miles away, so that polarities like good and evil or desire and repulsion seem to just evaporate while we watch. That last aspect alone would seem to land this story in Robert Eggers's wheelhouse. Part of the subversive energy of movies like \"The Witch,\" \"The Lighthouse\" and \"The Northman\" derives from what feels like modern takes on historical characters in thrall to dark passions so that the distantly historical is both granted its strangeness and animated by a scrutinizing modern sensibility. At its best, his version both evokes and reconceives Murnau's most brilliant visual ideas. Murnau's masterful use of the opacities of dark archways from which the vampire can emerge and into which he can dissolve is both echoed and made new. Murnau's famously arresting use of shadows to visualize the vampire's defiling reach is reimagined when those shadows in this new version extend themselves in a 360-degree pan that evokes their vertiginous inescapability. And the shadow of the vampire's hand now extends across the entire city, repurposing the most memorable image from Murnau's \"Faust.\"", "video": null, "screenshot": null, "prompt_instruction": "You are a professional English-to-Maasai translator, tasked with providing translations suitable for use in Kenya (mas_KE).

It was no different at the 2025 N.F.L. Honors earlier this month. Everything about the red-carpet photos accentuates their Evel Knievel-size age gap: Belichick looks sedately pleased in a maroon blazer, like a car dealer at a Shriners banquet; Hudson beams in a sparkly Cirque du Soleil-style number that covers approximately 12 percent of her torso. That's what most people seemed to notice about the pictures.\n\nBut not Dave Portnoy. The founder and owner of Barstool Sports - the Utne Reader for the light-domestic-swilling, backslapping, Zyn-packing, parlay-chasing American male - Portnoy has long been treated as an avatar for everything that elite media is not. Barstool might be considered the outermost ring of the so-called manosphere, the vast realm of male-oriented alternative media that has been credited with the rightward drift of the young male vote. Portnoy - a Trump supporter with a long history of misogynistic comments and bullying, who has been accused of nonconsensually filming women during uncomfortably rough sex - doesn't exactly run away from that label. (He has denied the claims about sexual misconduct and filed a suit against the outlet that published them; it was dismissed.) And what he noticed about the photos of Belichick and Hudson was the clutch Hudson wore, which was shaped like a little football: \"Very cool purse from BB's girlfriend,\" he posted on X. \"Football girlfriend purse.\"\n\nIt's certainly possible that Portnoy, a die-hard Patriots fan, was being ironic, conveying something like, \"I refuse to see anything unusual here.\" But I would bet that he genuinely did like the purse. I would make that bet because I have spent many hours watching Portnoy's most fascinating nonsports media product, his \"One Bite\" pizza reviews, and I know about his softer side. He has been doing these reviews for 12 years, though I first encountered them during the pandemic. I was, at that point, ambiently aware of Portnoy, but only for all the stuff people hated about his website: the \"Smokeshow of the Day\" photos, the army of online \"Stoolies\" who mobbed his many critics. But if you watch the pizza videos, you're reminded that most of the stuff these controversial media figures do is entirely normal. A lot of the time, it's downright amusing.\n\nEach episode of \"One Bite\" begins with Portnoy's walking out the door of the business under consideration, then executing the entirety of his review right out front, sometimes practically blocking foot traffic, often with the proprietor looking on anxiously. Given all this, the concept seems almost cruel: He buys an entire pie but reviews the pizza based on one bite. \"One bite,\" goes the motto. \"Everybody knows the rules.\" The reason for this, Portnoy explained in an early video, is that the response has to be immediate, beneath the level of consciousness, like a \"Rotchbloch\" test. But Portnoy can never limit himself to one bite, typically finishing about half a slice of molten pizza, blowing big cheekfuls of air on it the way you would for a toddler, balancing the rest of the pie in his other hand as he tries to sort out where it belongs on his 10-point scale.", "video": null, "screenshot": null, "prompt_instruction": "You are a professional English-to-Maasai translator, tasked with providing translations suitable for use in Kenya (mas_KE).

Was no metal plates. They'd just painted over the glass with some metallic paint. Luckily this can be just scraped off, presumably with some paint dissolving solvents applied too. Dunno. I let the professionals handle that.\n\nThe folks that can do an actually good job of converting it into a microcamper are busy till July, so I get to play at doing a half arsed job to tide it over until then.\nFirst job is taking out the floor to gain access to that underfloor area and to cover that in linoleum. Had some lying around after they did the bathroom last year.\nThen to refit the floor and cover all that in a red felt carpet.\nThe job is shoddy here really. What's needed is to insulate the entire body of the car and then cover professionally and well, but I dunno how to do all that. I just used spray glue to fasten this stretch carpet to the existing wood, that'll be replaced when it's converted proper anyway.\nThe roof will remain cold and metal till then.\n\nThis chair works very well in the van. Should ideally be fastened better to the floor, but it has a nice three mode positions.\nSeating, and chaise-long, and flat as a bed with the passenger seat folded down.\n\nYou can get a folding leaf table, and if you saw off the bottom 15cm or so of the panels forming the sides and front of the table, and also don't bother to attach any of the the back leaf, then it becomes just the right height to mostly fit under the rear window.\nIt's a little higher than the camper-fridge, but the camper fridge is pretty much the same height as a little bedside cabinet.\nThere's also a small rectangular sink that fits nicely around the same width as the fridge alongside that cut down table.\nAnd thus, the interior can be mostly constructed in my flat. The kids in the flat upstairs kept waving as me as I was doing a terrible job of cutting down those panels with a jigsaw in the yard.\n\nThen there's a whole day of carrying those things out to the van and trying to screw them into the floor.\nHad to swap the fridge and the cabinet around from the plan. The fridge is less deep than it is wide and doesn't block the table-leaf when it's at the edge with door facing the front of the car.\nI expected to have to pause here and measure up and buy some wood, but someone had thrown out a desk that matches very well and a bit more sawing managed to get that into the right shape to build a frame to hold everything in place.\nThat sink is attached by only one of the six grips that are supposed to hold it. Two can't be used flat against a wooden board, and 3 aren't against anything at all right now.\nMaybe I can get to attach better when the pump and tap arrive.\n\nI like the easy access to battery and water and things from the back. Fair amount of storage there too which is accessible from inside if the table is up.\nStill need to put the water pump into the water cannister, and power it, and attach some sort of tap to it.\n\nAnd that's about as good a job as I can do really. Hopefully some of it will still be useable in a few months when it's done properly by a professional.\nAt least the fridge ought to carry over.\nThe bed folding down past the passenger seat is great. I'm too talk for this van really, but that makes it workable. Shame the seat/bed has to be so narrow though. The two-seater was very temping and feels like it ought to just about fit but, wouldn't really be any way to unfold it from within the van and the steering wheel gets in the way for folding the driving seat down like the passenger seat does so couldn't really go flat without also lifting up.\n\nThank goodness for Blender! Not sure I could have planned all that and had any hope of it all working out if I couldn't do it in virtual 3d first.\n3 frames to show the 3 main configurations.

Oriel Oxford (530 students) vs Durham (20,000), and Oriel won, which surprised me after some mistakes they made. The captain didn't know Wittengstein's name!? Possibly just nerves. Durham was ahead, then it was tied at 170, then they dropped to 165. A pity. I was rooting for them. Great team, with all four strong, so I hope they make the cut.\n\nGame 10 of #UniversityChallenge had a great performance by Christ's Cambridge, who have a consultative captain, a good team, and a strong member named Bethlehem, so Roger Tilling called out \"Christ's Bethlehem!\" Exeter Oxford never got hold of much, and are out of the running. I could see Christ's Cambridge quietly going far in this series. \nSome nice math questions, a picture round connected to food, and a tricky flag question. Good game.\n\nGame 11 of #UniversityChallenge was St Andrews (granted university status by an antipope!) vs Cardiff. First round is nearing its end. Some good questions, including mentions of roll-on roll-of ferries, Agnes Martin, and Stax Records. Cardiff Tarsala will never forget her Booker T bloomer, I'm afraid. Nice quizzing from both teams, though it only really got cracking in the last few minutes.\n\nGame 12 of #UniversityChallenge was Leeds vs Edinburgh. Leeds took a long time to get going, then had a surge in the middle but couldn't keep it going. Seemed like a number of film questions this time, and I was glad to hear PEI as an answer; no flags, though it seems like they crop up every time. Edinburgh Myles is a good captain and the whole team is strong and works well together. I think they'll do well.\n\n#UniversityChallenge game 13 was a curious one, with Leicester being jokey, wasting time and never getting going, while the LSE captain would often turn to the farthest player for an answer, which was not infrequently wrong. Still, LSE cleaned up. I liked the blues bonus round, though sadly Leicester got none. Canadian mentions: WL Mackenzie King and Margaret Atwood. The best part was Roger Tilling saying \"Leicester Lister!\"\n\nGame 14 of #UniversityChallenge was top-notch stuff, solid quizzing, down to business, fast answers, good knowledge, close ending. It seems we'll see both SOAS London and St. Edmund Hall Oxford again, because the loser makes the repechage. Very close at the finish, down to \"Naples\" and \"pollen.\" An unassumingly great game.\n\nGame 15 of #UniversityChallenge is the first of two in the repechage, where the four highest-scoring losing teams try to make it through. This week was UCL and St. Andrews, in a good-natured cheery match. Very strong play from UCL, who have a solid team, and UCL Mandel was in top form. Good questions, some tough, such as requiring \"panthera\" specifically or knowing \"day\" in Russian.\n\nJust got to game 16 of #UniversityChallenge today, a week late, and it was a nail-biter! Really fast work at the end, with Durham coming from behind in the last few minutes to catch SOAS London in a tie in the final seconds. It went to a starter question that I got on the first clue (being an SF reader I knew \"slipstream\") but neither team knew. Second question and SOAS London Lambert guessed alpaca but it was llama, so Durham won. Phew, what a finish. 😰\n\nGame 17 of #UniversityChallenge is the first of eight knockout games in the second round. This was UCL and LSE, and UCL gave an outstanding performance: very fast buzzing, good teamwork, wide general knowledge from them all (UCL Mandel notable again); they took off at the start and never slowed. Very impressive.\n\nGame 18 of #UniversityChallenge was Durham vs Open University. I was rooting for Durham, who have a great team, but in the end to my surprise Open took it, after a number of rather slow answers. I was glad Durham got Marcel Duchamp right on one question; too bad no one knew Yoko Ono as a Fluxus artist. Much respect for Durham Nash, especially on bird silhouettes and flags.\n\nGame 19 of #UniversityChallenge was Exeter vs Bristol. Bristol got going at the start and never looked back, rolling with momentum, finishing with an incredible score. Exeter only clawed their way back to 0 after 17 minutes. \nI liked the question on common terms in Chinese place names, such as 北 (běi) in Beijing etc. Good geographic knowledge shown.\n\n#UniversityChallenge is back from the Christmas alumni series, and game 20 was liked greased lightening in comparison. Darwin Cambridge Whitaker tore into questions like a monster, but everyone was in good form on that team and also on Edinburgh. Momentum changed through the game. Good quizzing. Three more games in round two, then the long quarter-finals.\n\nIt's quite a change to go from the Christmas series of #UniversityChallenge, where four people didn't know the name of the narrator of Moby-Dick even when told his name is in the first sentence of the book, to the regular round, where they're racing to buzz on questions like \"Fifty-three British thermal units is to grouse hunting as Sydney, Australia, is to what famous star of the London stage?\"\n\nGame 21 of #UniversityChallenge was Wadham Oxford vs Imperial. What a game! Astounding performance from Imperial. \nHowever, being King Crimson fan, I was disappointed that no one recognized them from the opening of \"21st Century Schizoid Man,\" and dismayed when someone thought \"I Zimbra\" by Talking Heads (with Fripp on guitar) was by the Bee Gees. Can't have it all. I remain incredibly impressed.\n\nGame 22 of #UniversityChallenge was Christ's Cambridge vs St Edmund Hall Oxford, two small colleges, but that's how the rules are set up.  Nice picture round with the Dunning-Kruger effect, Asch conformity experiments, and bouba-kiki effect.  Another on mushrooms, which seemed tough to me; identifying them by eye is not easy. Solid game, good playing all around.\n\n#UniversityChallenge game 23 was Cardiff against Queen's Belfast. Ended with a lower score than I felt it would get, maybe due to missed bonuses, but the starters were buzzed fast. Nice flag knowledge, and a good picture round identifying physical laws by diagrams of experiments. A bit too much bantz for my taste, but a solid game.

Because I actually have to do some tech-related talks this month, and also with the dark side of tech being so blatant lately, I felt the need to think about it more, and explore my associations/values etc!\n\nMarch 1 - Starting with the 10 of Wands, typically representing overload, burden.\nHere it is represented by a variety of early computing projects, many subsidized by their respective governments.\nI think of how before a computer or calculator was a thing it was a job. Even after they existed, people still had to mediate, calculate, punch cards, interpret, etc. And in my own work I still often feel like a babysitter of inflexible computational quirks... why can't the spreadsheet software, or CMS, or database just do that mind-numbingly boring and burdensome stuff for me?\nI also think how, even if it's built on what were once dull analog tasks, it's not -exactly- the same though, is it? In middle school computer lab I was taught a bit of BASIC, and being able to make a simple text \"frogger\" or branching adventure program, even if they were super rudimentary, was more compelling for some reason than imagining them or drawing them in a notebook... the sort of action at a delay/distance that computing offers, or that is computing's illusion...\n\nMarch 2 - 9 of Swords... following on from the feelings of overload and burden yesterday, this card represents nightmares and anxiety about the future.\nAppropriately it's represented here by The Tavistock Institute of Human Relations, a UK governmental body established in 1946 that acted regionally, nationally, and internationally for “the social engagement of social sciences” or more bluntly, using theoretical methods to “change behavior in groups and civilian populations.”\nObviously the name Tavistock brings to mind the overbearing interference of the UK government in constantly trying to block any sort of trans care, or only dispensing it as a last resort after you’ve gone through years of waiting around and a thorough psychiatric probing. A population where everyone just conformed to the two standard cis gender roles would indeed be much easier to control, so to a “Labour” government obsessed with means testing, pathologizing and cutting benefits, it’s of course desirable to treat “normality” as a virtue and any difference as disease to eliminate.\nI could talk about so many things, the awful CBT and soft conversion therapy I’ve personally received in the UK, how state surveillance and punishment disproportionately targets autistic people, how even punitive and inadequate psychological care is too hard to access, how outcomes are measured in “productivity” rather than happiness. A tendency that is not technic in the big machines or internet enabled devices way, but has infested every aspect of life as much as people fear tiktok attention spans have; people I want to ally with constantly crowing “just be normal” or getting sucked down a health and fitness grifthole.\nAn exhausting and sad card. I’ll be honest, I almost put it back when I pulled it lol. But obviously a big part of contemporary technological thought nevertheless.\n\nMarch 3 - The Star, hope, inspiration, future goals. A much more positive card than we've had so far!\nBut it's hard to feel positive about the massively exploitative and yet still totally underwhelming reality of artifical intelligence and quantum computing hype at the moment. The idea of an omnipotent computer, that could, indeed, simulate or work at an atomic or subatomic level, has kind of been the great dream of computing for a long time. It's almost a philosopher's stone type of thing.\nYesterday I reread this great essay on the current generative AI models by Hito Steyerl (https://newleftreview.org/issues/ii140/articles/hito-steyerl-mean-images). She does a great job of going into how reliant these systems still are on human-made images, cleaned data, and ongoing human moderation at every level, but she also makes the observation that while their outputs masquerade as bits of text or images, which people wrongly attribute intention or creativity to, they're really statistical representations, with all of the inherent ideology and limitations of statistics baked in.\nWhat would a truly intelligent computer capable of expanding our analytical powers and relieving the burden of tedious labor and the risks of incomplete information look like, and under what context would it be used to reinvent life towards more autonomy and joy rather than accelerating exploitation and control? Can we hope for such a thing with IBM and DARPA still in the picture...?\n\nMarch 4 - The King of Swords, intellectual drive, clarity, calling for authoritative action. A go-for-it type of thing.\nTimothy Leary certainly was a sort of intellectually driven, though more of a “question authority” type. Likewise, looking it up, the Eight-circuit Model of Consciousness here is generally thought to have little actual scientific credibility. Still… what model of consciousness does? Despite being how all of our “information” comes to us, it’s kind of ambiguous what this thing actually is, much less if there’s any systemic patterns that determine how it works.\nI find it kind of inspiring to contemplate a multi-part model of consciousness that is both inward and outward looking. Leary was also of a period where there was optimism about space exploration, and the possibility of making contact with other species, from Earth or beyond. Now we seem to find this idea kind of embarrassing, because the idea of explaining ourselves feels embarrassing. Which in a way is it’s own kind of constantly-reinforcing self-centeredness.\nThere’s nothing more self-centered in the irritating way than how psychedelics as self-help, a “miracle” mental illness cure, the one weird trick to go 10x or come up with that sick disruptive business deal or chill out your bitch wife, have kind of become mainstream now. It’s all very inward-looking to the point that there’s nothing besides inward-ness. What’s the point of a honed mind if you can’t, like the king of swords, point it outwards?\n\nMarch 5 - Five of Pentacles... A difficult situation, struggle, financial insecurity.\nInfrastructure... precisely that thing it never feels like there's enough cash for. ESPECIALLY in tech, where it always flows towards hype and disruption rather than maintaining what already exists.\nThe Internet is so huge, has such great practical benefits, and is an important part of so many peoples' lives, that of course we want the infrastructure maintained, and there to be good governance... Maybe it was the hype of the Internet itself that allowed some of these early gestures towards standardization and productive ground rules to stick.\nThough there are a ton of tech corporations involved, a surprising amount was also done via the US Department of Defense directly, and now a lot of the corporations (ex- Don't Be Evil Google, for example) are chipping away at the principles they once helped set up... Whose infrastructure? It's always tied to governance, and always ideological. Be careful who you go asking for cash when you're broke...\n\nMarch 6 - DEATH!! An inevitable and total transformation, possibly painful, but not necessarily The End...\nA lot of anti-tech sentiment seems to wish that we could just put certain things back in the box. But the world where the technology that provides connection and access to information was entangled by its maybe well-intentioned originators with military and surveillance culture, game theory and bombs, is the world we have.\nI always found the PVP gimmick for MGSV's online mode to be weirdly inspiring... if we want to live in a world without the atomic bomb, it'll have to be one where we took them all apart with our own hands. And it'll be one where the knowledge that it was made at one time will also always be a thing. How we frame it is up to us... there is no going back.

{"dataset_id": "wmttest2025", "collection_id": "general", "doc_id": "en-mas_KE_#_social_#_114294867111841563", "domain": "social", "src_lang": "en", "tgt_lang": "mas_KE", "src_text": "Even though I've mostly transitioned to PC gaming over the past decade, my preferred peripherals are still controllers.\nI understand the advantages of KB+M play, but as someone who already uses those tools for work I find picking up a controller helps separate the two activities and gives my wrists a break. I've also been playing video games long enough to see the technology and layouts used drastically change, though some first party controllers seem to have stagnated a bit.\nI recently found a controller I really liked because it has features that have really impressed me enough to want to talk about it at length, but to do that I feel the need for some context; not a whole history lesson, just a little stroll through my collection of controllers that materialized over a lifetime of engaging in this hobby.\nBy the end I hope you'll understand why this is a topic I care so much about I'd spend all day talking about these devices.\n\nMy decision to build up a PC game collection started during the transition between the Xbox 360 and the Xbox One; I thoroughly enjoyed the 360, but the One was looking like a disaster. Since the new consoles from all three major companies held little interest and I'd been in school for Computer Information Systems, I got myself a 360 pc dongle and resolved to make the switch.\nEach of these controllers saw extensive use, and the 360 had the asymmetrical stick placement I preferred. All but two of the controllers in this picture are currently unusable either from loose/drifting sticks, faulty buttons, or failing cables/connections; both of the working ones are 3rd party Afterglows (which have their own problems).\nAs much as I loved these controllers, the official ones were the worst in terms of durability, and some were faulty from day one but Microsoft would refuse my RMA request.\nIt got worse when I tried the most expensive one.\n\nThere was a time when I fell for the myth that \"You get what you pay for\" was as true for expensive stuff as it was for cheap stuff; it's because of this controller that I know better. I got this Elite Series 2 controller despite knowing the first iteration had some serious flaws.\nThat controller lasted just under a year before the stick drift started to set in, and the right bumper only registered half of the time. The cable it came with sucks ass, never worked with any other controllers. The lag from using bluetooth was so bad the dongle was practically necessary. On top of all that, the back paddles didn't work no matter what software/drivers I used, none of my games ever read those paddles as an inputs.\nThe Raikiri Pro (was bundled with a laptop) is my current dedicated desktop controller and it works fine [for now], but I will never spend another dime on Official Xbox branded controllers. Fuck Microsoft, I hope Xbox rots!\n\nThe Nintendo Switch reignited my love for portable gaming after years of surviving out of crappy laptops. The joycons were small but versatile, and the pro controller felt really comfortable in the hands.\nI loved these controllers so much I modified them and swapped in hall-effect sticks [and metal latches] this past year, and while I'm well aware of the drift issue, mine have worked flawlessly since 2017 with no signs of wearing out. I've put just as many hours into these controllers as I did all those Xbox controllers; either I got very lucky or microsoft designs their controllers to fail faster than both of their competitors combined. Nintendo's offerings have some drawbacks, but the fact it's additional features like Gyro input have been officially supported is noteworthy.\nI hope to keep these controllers working for as long as they continue to be supported on other platforms; there are many like them, but these ones are mine.\n\nA brief note on Play Station controllers to round out the 1st party lineup: I never liked them.\nDual Shock 1-3 felt exactly the same to me with exactly the same flaws: Oversized thumbsticks placed too close together, mushy face/shoulder/trigger buttons that seemed to wear out very quickly, and a D-pad that just felt wrong. Dual Shock 4 fixed a lot of problems, but introduced a bunch of new ones. I got a Dual Sense because some friends had a hard time with asymmetrical thumbsticks, and for some reason local stores were selling them for $20 less than DS4 controllers.\nI don't really use this controller: Face buttons are spaced too far apart, my audio in/output keeps defaulting to the controller when it's connected, the bumpers are weirdly tall, and I keep accidentally pressing the track pad when trying to hit menu/share.\nThey are fine guest controllers that have come a long way in terms of design, but for me they're a novelty at best.\n\n8BitDo was my first foray into good 3rd party controllers. This original SN30 Pro (later versions have hall-effect sticks and do not come in the SNES colour scheme) remains one of my favourites because holding it is reminiscent of my first console, the SNES.\nIf I'm having a crappy day and need a nostalgic escape, this is the first controller I reach for. It has all the functionality of a Switch Pro controller, but compacted into a modernized rendition of the SNES controller, complete with concave X/Y + convex A/B buttons, and possibly the best D-pad I've ever used. It's got some minor problems, but it's been a constant source of comfort.\nOne day the sticks will fail, or the battery will discharge for the last time; but if it means getting one of the modern versions (with hall-effect sticks) and shell-swapping them, I'll do it when the time comes.\nWith such a connection, surely 8BitDo can't do better than this, right? Well...\n\nWhen I want the familiar comforts of the SN30 Pro but with all the features of a modern controller, the 8BitDo Pro 2 has been my multi-platform controller of choice.\nEverything about this is a functional upgrade from the SN30 Pro: more comfortable grips, hall-effect sticks, analog triggers, programmable back paddles, a physical X/D/S/A mode toggle switch, and a [somewhat] easily replaceable battery with the option of using AAs in a pinch. I also sprung for the carrying case and the mobile phone holster, which doesn't see as much use with a phone (I don't trust its grip that much), but for more compact retro emulation handhelds, it can expand the list of playable games to include ones that need precise analog controls.\nThere's very few negatives I can say about this controller, but it sits at a close 3rd for favourite controller of my collection. I'll talk about my number 2 pick in a moment, but before that I need to talk about...\n\nHow hard is it to find a modernized N64 controller?\nThere are plenty of cheap N64 imitation controllers, but the three-pronged original was an objectively bad design. I could play N64 games with a modern controller using clever configuration to make the face buttons function as C-buttons, but it's not the same for so many reasons.\nI got the RetroFighters Brawler 64 to solve this anachronistic conundrum, and it's gone above and beyond my expectations. It was made to mimic the official NSO N64 controller down to the Switch recognizing it as one, with a toggle to make it register as a Pro controller sans right-stick.\nIt has some problems, but between its layout and compatibility it solves way more problems the official version has. It's perfect for showing someone N64 emulation without the intimidation of the original or the anachronism from finagling a modern controller to work the same.\nIt's very good at what it's trying to do.\n\nI got this steam controller from a pawn shop after negotiating the price down shortly after the fire sale came to an end on steam. It needed some TLC, and I did what I could to get it up and running again.\nIt remains one of the most customizable controllers in my collection, with a unique [if questionable] design and features ahead of it's time (gyro aim, back paddles, haptic feedback, etc). It has some problems though; It requires AAs, uses Micro-USB for wired connections, occasionally turns itself back on after being turned off, the back paddles are stiff enough to cause fatigue, the thumbstick cap is necessary since the rubber on it is deteriorating, and it's functionality tends to fluctuate with every update to steam input.\nIt's more of a unique historical artifact than a regularly used input, but it's a welcome addition and fun to tinker with on rainy days.\nIt also isn't my number 2 pick, that honour goes to the fact that...\n\nThe 8BitDo Ultimate Bluetooth controller is an almost perfect controller.\nHall-effect sticks, included charging dock that doubles as a port for the included dongle, dedicated 2.4ghz/bluetooth toggle switch, NS Pro layout with a much improved D-pad, analog triggers, and programmable back paddles. When I sit down on a couch with this controller, I can swap between a Steam Deck and a Switch faster than the time it takes the TV to switch inputs.\nIt does have some drawbacks though: It only does X/Switch signals (no android or apple modes), the triggers are uncomfortable, and input lag seems to be affected by the time it took to connect to the dongle/switch.\nI thought this was the best it could get, but like my time with Xbox controllers I was operating on assumptions that started to sound like old brand loyalty reflexes coming back. What I'd hoped to upgrade it to was such a disappointment it swiftly shook me from those assumptions.", "video": null, "screenshot": "assets/en/social/114294867111841563-anon", "prompt_instruction": "You are a professional English-to-Maasai translator, tasked with providing translations suitable for use in Kenya (mas_KE).

Several Beers flavor? Indica Nightmare?\n\nits then that the immortal words of mao resonate through my loaded taco skull to go investigate instead of fantasizing about Difficult Conversation Doritos so i go and try to track down doritos late night line. 500 food products are released to the US public every year and about 480 of them disappear within 6 months and pepsico knows this which is why they don't do any marketing or advertisement - blind drops at the corner, secret boxes where the arrival IS the announcement. theres very little\n\nwhat i manage to collate is this: there are three other flavors of late night doritos: Sizzlin' Cheeseburger (?), Last Call Jalapeno Poppers (??) and \"Chili Sandwich\", which is not a flavor. however in my attempts to find out anything about the doritos late night line, i stumble upon DORITOS AFTER DARK @ THE CRYPTO.COM STADIUM, the official doritos concept restaurant. thinking that the marketing is perhaps a near-miss, i nearl yclose the tab but for spotting LATE NIGHT in copyright font.\n\nwhat i have concluded is as follows:\n- doritos after dark, which is not a chips brothel, has nearly nothing to do with doritos late night, despite both being named the same thing and having near-identical branding. i assume this is something like when your older brother gives you a shirt with his name monogrammed on the lapel\n- everybody responsible for doritos after dark is going to loaded hell\n\nwe don't necessarily need an ersatz munch squad about this - we live in america, the average manhole leads to the garden of earthly delights original mario bros movie style, so why should the lakers arena be necessarily different. it's, like, fair food, no worse than fried oreos. even so, there is something perhaps post-fierian about the ramen-rito, a burrito where the primary carbohydrate substrate is cooked ramen, and which advertises \"fresh scallions\". Uh, yeah, I sure hope it does.\n\nto dine here is to reap the wine-dark benefits of being a ticketholder at the crypto.com stadium, home of the fucking lakers - i don't know how much lakers tickets cost, but i do know that the lakers are basically the yankees of basketball, which means the price of a ticket is counted in teeth. so yes. \"Kick it up a notch.\" \"Taste a bold new act.\" wh - why is that doritos bag so *airbrushed?* it's giving adam sandler click. but i'm nitpicking here. It's your The Lakers, you choose the food.\n\nNah.\n\nyou know that picture of the guy with the shirt that says 0 fears and then bart swimpson porn is banned so it says 1 fear? It's similar to that except now i am afraid to eat the home cooking of anybody i do not know intimately because there is a slim yet extant chance that i might sit down to a delicious home cooked normals dinner to eat with them in their house and similar to judas at the famous dinner they might kiss my cheek good-like then serve me up \"COOL RANCH BISCUITS WITH HONEY BUTTER\"\n\nlike ther eis undoubtedly, because the world is so so so sosososoo big and we are so small one person per person and information is so big and free, somebody who has made this, and then served it to someone who does not have the same brain as them. homecooked food is meant to be eaten. like it's a social problem now, sitting down in your breaksfast nook, or your table, and your wifey brings in a charcuterie board, like this, and you have to eat it. or it's bad for you. like as a person.\n\nthere's a lot of things that are wrong with america. this doesn't clock the 15th percentile. it's just an average sort of excess, another straw on the like last descendant of the great plains buffalo's ailing back. even so, even being as jaded to the way that americans eat as i am, having ordered a one-scoop cup of superman flavor ice cream last night, i find that i have not and could never reach rock bottom. there is a 121st day of sodom, my uncle who works at nintendo told me about it.", "video": null, "screenshot": "assets/en/social/114300646822630777-anon", "prompt_instruction": "You are a professional English-to-Maasai translator, tasked with providing translations suitable for use in Kenya (mas_KE).

A thread\nNote: all major updates will start with the thread emoji\nIm attempting to move to Germany and find a new life! Follow this thread to follow this journey\nThe last 32 hours or so were HORRIBLE! Panic attack, extreme fatigue, nausea.\nBut! Look at where I am! The airport!! I fucking did it!\nI pushed myself too hard and ended up not sleeping for 32 hours. As of right now (write now) I am on the 33rd hour :p. Looking back, this is the way, and it wouldnt have happened any other way. ADHD is a Tanzanian to tame. \nEDIT: tazmanian.\nI have done so much in the last 3 months! I thought it would have only taken me 1 month, but severely underestimated EVERYTHING. Rebooked the flight twice, but with 2 deadlines, this plane is it! \nGosh.. I met with realtor, packed (most) of the house, gave a 1/3 of my stuff away, the appropriate ppl have access to the rest, and my sister can be a PoA should need be. 7 or so documents apostille'd, degree recognized in Germany, language coarse booked, (potentially a scam) appartment rental reserved, vital documents ascertained! I also have a internationally certified document proving I am not a criminal! ITS GO TIME!\n\n🧵 Officially in Germany! Got my Visa, new SIM card in (Spain) and awaiting the train to Köln.\nGotta be honest. I screwed myself with bags. Too heavy for this smol trans girl 😅. Navigating where to get my luggage was fun! Turns out connections via train from plane are elsewhere. I'm usually pretty collected, but its a bit of stress Ill be honest. But only because as-it-stands right now, I have no support systems. I dont know this city. Have heavy luggages. Etc. Etc. \nI have never been more parched in my life! \nPs: I have a story from the plane that isnt appropriate for fedi. And thats saying something! (doesnt involve me) \nBooked a hotel (yea yea.. Late on that.. But i SHOULD have an appt. Tomorrow.) \nFirst impressions of Germany: architecture, even of the steel & glass of the train station, does not dissapoint! Germanic design totally didnt play any role in my choice of destinations 😝.\n\nOkay, the first German words to learn will have to be train & transit related. Future Indi, make a note!\nSeattle & San Francisco are the best public transits in America [citation needed] and once you figure it out, it really is zip zap zoom on and off and you're there! I want to get to that, but even living in Seattle it took me a few months.\n\n🧵 NOTE: Do NOT get on on the opposite end of the train when carrying 3 bags!\nI took note of the prev train and prepared to whre I thought was car 1.\nIm that bumbling American today 🚬😎\n\n🧵 A simple breakfast, but god is it good.\nI sure hope lactase enzymes are easily accessible in Deutschland, or else Im in trouble 😅. Nom nom nom 🥐\n\n🧵 I got my keys! Sweaty, hot, and went through an ordeal getting the keys from skeevy old man neighbor-building landlord who was totally hitting on me. Ugh. Sometimes it sucks being cute. \nDo i pass or something?! Or does he not care? XD\nI meet my landlord on Monday for anmeldung registration paper, mailbox name, contract (that I asked for) and the like. Ive been told having the keys bestows some tennant-rights/protections so we good. \nAppartment rental for 3-months though! Lets gooo\nEDIT: Reposted with keys erased\n\nFor those wondering, I still have my hotel room. I played it safe and didn't want to rely on being able to get keys yesterday with luggage in tow\n\n🧵 I now have a German telefonnummer! Exciting!\nThat travel sim I bought did help bridge the gap, but the service was horrendous and relied on roaming. I was also under the impression it could dial out, which it could not. I already needed to call a German number.\nThe SIM salesperson was also an expat (not american) and I had the nicest conversation! He wanted tips with learning programming*, and I asked how long to learn German and he was super inspiring! Saying that those who must learn—like for work—learn much more and faster! He encouraged me to keep with it and in 3 months I should be fine 🫶. \nI will try to keep my numver when I inevitably switch. I chose this from convenience. Being that he didnt even require me an address, only an ID to activate. \nAside: no, I didnt think D-Netz was a Deez Nuts reference... Ofc not xD. You're silly for even thinking that haha\n(*hes starting in Python! Which I think is the MOST fun, even if someone has to unlearn bad habits. I think its a valuable litmus test for those to see if programming is for them) \n\n🧵 Today's agenda:\n1. Finish professional CV (most important!)\n2. Find out how to get to private German language coarse (starts tomorrow, in-person). \n3. Trip to appartment from hotel with backpack (slowly bringing stuff over. I overencombered myself)\n4. Eat out! (food! Get ur mind out of the gutter! Lol) \nIm delaying being a tourist. I found out about the Köln-karte, a tourist 1-2 day pass that lets you do stuff. I dont nessisarily WANT to delay being a tourist... But shit has to get done. Ya know? Its different when I'm trying to establish a foothold. \nPlus it'll be good to do it in the week. Im in Köln M-Th for classes at 16:00-18:00. Meaning I could spend the best portion of the day outside ☀️💜\nKnow what didnt make the cut? What i had to nix? My fucking drawing tablet! It was an old Galaxy Book (wacam digitizer). But I really wanna draw! Thats how I want to visit Germany. Go to random place. Sketch. People watch. Sketch. Sure... Paper... But have you USED a digital canvas? Lol. Maybe Ill buy a used ipad.\n\n🧵 Time to go grocery shopping in this tiny town of 75k. Kinda nervous.\n---\nAlso I got bumped on my language course 😭. Not enough people this cycle. \nI inquired about normal attendance and they said I just so happen to get unlucky, because their A1.1 course is their most popular. But its all good! They DO have an online course that starts next week. Ill probably take that, even though I wanted to be in person for multiple reasons :p. Ill get started with my vocabulary with Anki/SRS in the meantime. LetMeTellYou I can study well 😬\n\n🧵 My first homecooked breakfast in my new home\nI made thebstrawberry compote from scratch using fresh strawberries. I had no spatula, coffee water from stove boiling. Everything is slightly harder without my wares :p\n\n🧵 A trick to ordering food in Germany:\nIf a number is called 5 times, it's your number\n\n🧵 Even the dogs here speak German! They are all wauwau insteaf of Bark Bark\n\n🧵 Omgosh free TV! I was thinking of buying a used one! And it says it works?\nCant read the rest. Must not be important.\nWell! I found out what the rest says! It says that the stand is broken and will fall down the tile stairwell making the absolute loudest sounds possible if not careful!\nNoted\n\n🧵 I swear... Every day in a new country is an absolute adventure! Nothing is easy!not even ordering coffee and treat.\nTasse cafe creme\n**gestures 1 finger up and points to pastry I dont even know what its calle din english**\nI KNEW she asked if it was for here or to go. I tried to gesture to go. But... Well.. End result is I ate in. Asked for a Kästchen on the way out. Got a bag! Alright! That one Ill count as a success.\nAnyone else's first days a whirlwind? I feel like Ive been here for weeks. No exaggeration! The midday naps in which I sleep harder than a tardigrade in a global ice age probably doesnt helo my sense of passage of time :p\n\n🧵 So I was upset to give away my Sodastream and Restaurant sized canister mod for it, because I've been big into fizzy water and making homemade healthy sodas.\nTURNS OUT Germany LOVES FIZZY WATER! You actually have to specify Flat sometimes! 😅 \nI just like it because when it's overcarbonated and you drink it and it's so intense it hurts... it feels refreshing! \n🫧🫧🫧🫧🫧🫧🫧🫧🫧🫧🫧🫧🫧🫧🫧🫧🫧🫧🫧🫧🫧🫧🫧🫧🫧🫧🫧🫧🫧🫧🫧🫧🫧🫧🫧🫧🫧🫧🫧🫧🫧🫧🫧🫧🫧🫧🫧🫧🫧🫧🫧🫧\n\n🧵 Okay... I dont want the honeymoon phase to end >_>. More great German things plz :P\nOkay. There are some downsides. All food tastes so..... how do I put it... German XD. Comically so!\nI've eaten Korean, Chinese, Taiwanese and Japanese cuisine now. And all of them have the distinct taste of.. sauerkraut?? But, it's in the rice itself. The part thats supposed to be the most neutral of flavor.\nI made Gnocci Carbonarra (white sause) and, while it was funking delicious, tasted like Brätwurst. I thought I was safe making food at home, but I'm not xD. \nNow, I've eaten authentic italian in Syracuse NY (it's an italian historic city) and been to Taiwan. So I wonder if given time my taste buds will adapt and I will think everything tastes like how I remember it. Like as if there are subtle tones I'm just not used to yet 🤔 . And hense why I THINK everything has a foreign taste to it.\nAside: Also these arn't new foods to me so Im comparing them to what I know. Versus trying... say... Ethiopian cuisine (something new)\n\n🧵 I am not officially registered in Germany! Anmeldung in-hand! Woo 🎉\nAnd I knew a lot for German than I thought in this exchange! I practiced German and she practiced English. (we both were being humble, but her English was good) \n\"Im sorry to ask... But are you man, woman, or divers?\" 💜💜\nWe proceeded to talk about that. And she said she wondered if maybe thats why I come from states and I was like: yes, its so nice to hear other people understand. Omg.\nShe said shes happy that people [like me] come and see Germany as a safe place 🫶\n\n🧵 Netflix has joined the list alongside Ebay, Amazon, and Zelle in deactivating/locking my accounts due to 'suspicious activity'. And amongst the greater list of systems putting me in what we'd call \"The Bad Flow\" at work. (The flowchart of what the worst-case scenario looks like for a probable bad-actor).\nFreenet Funk denied me 3 times, but the 4th went through. FINALLY received their sim card. Expatrio did finally accepted my totally valid proof of residence after declining it the first time (my literal proof of anmeldung, which they stated is valid...) and unlocked my account last week. And the money that went into the void? It did turn up. So not all things are perilously bad, but I am literally swimming upstream against a system hellbent on making my life as difficult as possible.\nAnd here is where I could talk about systemic oppression being literal digital systems, and how these issues wouldn't happen to someone who came over on a job transfer. But I came over the hard way, unregistered, and flagged one system which I'm sure triggered the next and the next. It all started around when I stopped doing tourist stuff :P. But ultimately my suspicious behavior is abruptly moving overseas. I was explicitly told so by the ebay personnel on the phone. (They even told me it's extremely unlikely for someone to move countries. so in ebay's case it sounds like you'd always get flagged).\nAside: A victory, buying laundry tokens from the hausmeister! I memorized a few words and shit bricks when I WhatsApp'd him and he called me immediately on the phone xD.\n\n🧵 My house was robbed.\nAlso, I'm sick again?! A relapse?\nI better get better before surgery in less than 23 days...\n\n🧵 Add Paypal to the list of accounts I got locked out of.\nAbsolutely unbelievable...\nUnfortunately, I dont know how to resolve this one. I tried calling US paypal and they wont touch German Paypal (I have 2 accounts. I'm supposed to have one account per country according to Paypal FAQ).\nBut I dont know German to navigate a fluid conversation like that of unlocking an account. And having someone help... is... this is sensitive stuff. So I'm at a crossroads.", "video": null, "screenshot": "assets/en/social/114417630342798842-anon", "prompt_instruction": "You are a professional English-to-Maasai translator, tasked with providing translations suitable for use in Kenya (mas_KE).

If perlini's going to win this one, she needs to be defensive and get everything back against sabalenka and hope that sabalenka maybe throws in a few errors after a long extended rally because we can see that that happens sometimes when perlini is playing types of players that do have big shots. If sabalenka's going to win this one, she needs to serve well and be patient and realize that there is going to be a lot of shots coming back and she's going to have to probably hit two, three, four extra shots each rally, so she's going to have to be patient and she's going to get the win. Top 10 clash, really fun matchup, but i have to go with sabalenka in straight sets.
