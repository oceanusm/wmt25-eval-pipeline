He studied the lines etched on his face, each one a reminder of the years gone by. A hint of gray threaded his hair now, and for a moment, he felt the weight of change settling in. \nHe didn’t want to label it an identity crisis. Not yet at least. But as he splashed the cold sink water on his face, memories of his pro hockey career flooded his mind. The thrill of the game, the adrenaline of competition, the love of the fans. All forty years of his life had practically been dedicated to making it to the highest level. Now those days were behind him. \n\nIt had been a remarkable twenty-year pro career, one that most players could only dream of. He wore a gleaming championship ring, a testament to his hard work and dedication. Kyle truly couldn’t have asked for more. With his wife and son by his side through every triumph and challenge, he was ready to step into this new chapter and return the favor they had shown him.\nToday marked a significant milestone for the Barnes family; Ryan’s first day of school in their new town. After Kyle’s retirement, they had chosen to relocate to New Hampshire so Ryan could attend St. Cassian’s, the prestigious hockey prep school where Kyle had once played. \n\nIt was usually his wife, Nicole, who ensured that milestones like this were executed flawlessly. But with his career behind him and plenty of free time ahead, they decided it was time to switch roles. After dedicating fifteen years to raising their son, Nicole was finally ready to return to work full-time and pursue her passion for interior design, leaving Kyle to navigate this unfamiliar routine on his own. \nKyle knew he should be excited, yet uncertainty tugged at him. Taking a deep breath, he forced himself to focus. It was time for Nicole and Ryan to take the lead, with his unwavering support behind them. He was determined not to let them down. \n\n“Fresh start,” he whispered to himself. “You got this.” \nKyle followed the enticing aroma of fresh coffee to the kitchen. Nicole was in the final moments of her new morning routine, screwing the lid onto her to-go cup. When she caught sight of him out of the corner of her eye, she flashed him a quick, warm smile.\n“Morning, Mr. Mom,” she said, her voice bright with excitement.\n“Morning,” he chuckled, closing the distance between them and pressing a kiss to her lips. “Pretty sure morning coffee is my new responsibility.”\n“You get a freebie today, rookie.” Nicole slung her purse over her shoulder and gave Kyle an encouraging pat on the backside as she passed him. “Alright, I’m outta here. Ryan needs to be downstairs in five minutes, and you two need to be out the door in ten. And don’t forget to snap at least one picture of him in his new uniform. I want a smile, or it doesn’t count!”\n\n“I’ll make sure he gets to school on time. No promises about the smiling part, though.”\n“If he behaves for the picture, tell him we can hit the diner after practice.”\n“Deal.” Kyle nodded. “Go get ’em, babe.”\nNicole winked at him as she opened the door to the garage. “Love you. Keep me updated!”\nAnd just like that, she was gone. The sudden silence was almost unsettling, prompting Kyle to pour himself a cup of coffee to distract his restless thoughts.\n“Hey, Ry! You about ready?” Kyle called up the stairs.\nSilence followed, typical for a teenager. Kyle settled at the table for the time being, scrolling through his phone. A new text pinged, and he tapped on it.\n\n“Barnesy.” It was from his old teammate, Luc Benoit, now coaching St. Cassian’s hockey team. “Need a favor. Meet me at the rink soon?” \n“Already need my advice on day one, Benny?” Kyle shot a teasing text back.\n“Just trying to keep you busy, old man.” \nKyle smiled at the jab. Even after all these years, their relationship had remained as lively and playful as it was in their twenties.\n”Be there in fifteen. Bout to drop off Ry.” \n“Shit,” he muttered under his breath when he checked the time. “Ryan William!” he yelled up the stairs. “If we’re late on your first day, your mom is going to skin me, and then I’m gonna skin you! Let’s go!”\n\n“I’m coming!” \nKyle pushed back from the table and swiftly poured his coffee from his favorite mug into a to-go cup. A moment later, the sound of hurried footsteps echoed down the stairs behind him. He grabbed his keys from the counter and turned to face his son.\n“Got everything?” Kyle asked. He took in the sight in front of him; his heart swelling with pride and a touch of nostalgia seeing his old school colors on his boy. \n“Yeah,” Ryan replied, tucking his school polo into his khaki pants. He noticed the warm expression on his dad’s face. “What’s with the look?”\n\n“Royal blue and gold really suit you, Champ.”\nRyan smirked and rolled his eyes. “You’re getting so soft in your old age.” \n“Is that so?” \nWith a playful grin, Kyle reached out to pinch the crook of Ryan’s neck, a gesture that had always made his son laugh.\nRyan burst into genuine laughter, tucking his chin and batting at Kyle’s hand to dodge the attack. “Okay, okay!”\n“That’s what I thought. Come on, let’s get moving.”\nKyle smiled and gave Ryan’s backside a light swat, nudging him along. They stepped outside, where the morning sun cast a warm glow over their freshly painted house, a vivid reminder of their recent move back to New England.\n\nThe atmosphere in the car was charged with a blend of anticipation and anxiety. Kyle could sense Ryan’s nervous energy radiating beside him, and he couldn’t help but remember his own first day, driven by his dad to this very school. He understood, probably more than anyone, the mix of excitement and fear his son was feeling.\nAs they pulled into the school parking lot, Kyle exhaled, taking in the stunning, castle-like buildings. He remembered just how much he loved this campus, especially in the fall when the foliage was at its peak.\n“Ready, buddy?” Kyle asked, glancing over as Ryan fiddled with his backpack in the passenger seat.\n\n“Yeah, I think so,” Ryan replied, his voice steady despite the nervous flutter in his stomach. There was a determination in his eyes that reassured Kyle.\n“Hey, you’ll do great,” Kyle said, offering a comforting smile. “But before you head to class, Mom wants a quick picture.”\nRyan groaned, anticipating the familiar routine. “Do we have to—”\n“Ryan,” Kyle replied, his tone light but firm. “Less attitude, please. You know the drill.”\nThey stepped out of the car, and Kyle quickly snapped a picture he knew Nicole would cherish. It wasn’t Ryan’s most enthusiastic smile, but it was a smile nonetheless.\n\n“I’ll see you at practice, okay?” Kyle wrapped an arm around Ryan’s shoulders, pulling him close and pressing a kiss to his soft, blonde curls. “Have a great day. Love you.”\n“Love you too.”\nKyle stood for a moment, watching as Ryan disappeared through the arched doorway of the main building. As the door swung shut behind his son, Kyle took a deep breath, knowing this was just the beginning of a new journey for them both.\nAfter a lifetime of strict schedules, the idea of an open day felt both liberating and daunting. So when Luc’s text came through this morning, Kyle was genuinely relieved, and a little thrilled, to have somewhere to be.\n\nHe made his way across campus toward the Griffin Den, the school’s storied ice rink, coffee in hand. The crisp morning air and familiar surroundings stirred something deep in his chest.\nKyle pushed open the doors to the rink, and the familiar scent of ice, rubber, and old gear hit him instantly. For the first time that day, he felt like himself. He stood in the stillness, letting the silence wash over him as he gazed out at the freshly zambonied sheet of ice, smooth and untouched, like a blank page waiting to be written on. \nKyle glanced up at the banners hanging from the rafters, his eyes quickly finding the year he and Luc had won their championship. The sight pulled him back in time, memories flooding in all at once, sharp and vivid, like the ice was still beneath his skates.\n\nSuddenly, a voice cut through his thoughts. “The good ol’ days, eh, Barnesy?”\nKyle turned to see Luc emerging from his office, a grin on his face as he walked over.\nKyle resisted the urge to roll his eyes at that grin. It was annoying as hell that Luc still looked like he belonged on the cover of GQ , even after a grueling pro hockey career of his own.\n“Just what I needed, another reminder that I’m getting old,” Kyle said with a chuckle. “It’s surreal being back. Seeing all this again…it feels like a lifetime ago.”\n“You’ll get used to it,” Luc said with a smile, reaching out for a firm handshake and pulling Kyle into a quick shoulder-clap hug, the kind of greeting that hadn’t changed since they were teammates.\n\nKyle noticed the file in Luc's hand, its edges worn from use. “What’s this? Got a scouting report for me?” he asked, curiosity piqued as he leaned in slightly, eager to hear what Luc had to share.\n“This,” Luc hummed as he tapped the file with his free hand, “is the favor. I’ll fill you in on the details. Come on, let’s sit.”\nKyle looked momentarily puzzled but settled onto the cold metal bleachers beside him.\n”So, we’ve got a last-minute addition, and usually we don’t make exceptions, right? Once the roster is finalized over the summer, that’s typically it,” Luc began. “But this kid is something special. I’m telling you, man, he’s got insane potential.”\n\nLuc handed the file to Kyle, who opened it with interest. \"Declan Avery Hull\" was printed in bold letters across the top, accompanied by a photo paperclipped to the top right corner. Kyle mentally noted the boyish features: deep green eyes, shiny, long, floppy brunette hair, and a bold expression that suggested confidence. His gaze then shifted to the hockey resume, and he raised his eyebrows at its impressive details.\nKyle let out a low whistle, the sound escaping him like a mix of surprise and admiration. “Damn, this kid is going to be a stud.”\n“Just wait until you see him play, he arrives tomorrow,” Luc said, his tone shifting slightly. “But I do have some concerns.”\n\n“With what?” Kyle asked, unable to find anything amiss in the details his eyes were scanning on the page.\nLuc flipped to the back, where the more personal information was stored, and pointed to the notes section with his finger.\nKyle read the first bullet point: “Off-ice behavior must be addressed if he wants to reach his full potential.”\nHis eyebrows instinctively raised at that, a knowing look passing between them as he turned to Luc. “Sounds like he’s a bit of a wildcard, huh?”\nLuc sighed, shaking his head as he fell deep into thought. “I don’t want to make excuses for him. Hell, I don’t even know him yet. But the kid has been bouncing from boarding school to boarding school for most of his childhood. That can’t be helping, right? I think what he really needs is stability.”\n\n“Where are the parents?” Kyle asked, the question feeling all too obvious given his own experiences. \nHe and Nicole had made it a priority to effectively manage their son’s off-ice behavior throughout his upbringing, committed to ensuring no negative bullet points marred his hockey resume. Any acting out was always nipped in the bud, immediately.\n“Mom’s not in the picture; hasn’t been since he was a baby, from what I hear,” Luc replied. “And the dad isn’t very present; he doesn’t show up to any games. Just writes the checks when he needs to.”\n“Shit,” was all Kyle could manage in response.\n\n“Yeah,” Luc sighed, shaking his head in frustration. “I just don’t feel right being just another boarding school for him, you know? He needs something more, something different. He needs a hockey family .”\nKyle couldn’t agree more; he felt a deep empathy for the kid. Having experienced the support of a tight-knit hockey family throughout his own career, he understood how crucial that foundation was.\n“How can I help, Benny?” he asked, his tone sincere.\n“I thought about taking the kid in, but I know he won’t want to live with the coach,” Luc began. “I realize this is a big ask, and I won’t be offended if you say no-“\n\nKyle cut in, finishing Luc’s thought. “You want us to be his billet family.”\nLuc nodded thoughtfully. “I’ve seen firsthand how you and Nicole raised Ryan, and just look at how incredible he turned out. If Declan has a support system like yours, it could be a game changer for him.”\nKyle took a moment to ponder. This wasn’t merely a simple favor; this was a responsibility for another soul. He hadn’t anticipated considering taking in a kid when he read Luc’s text that morning. Still, he would do anything for Luc, and the earnest look in his eyes made it clear just how serious this was to him. That meant it was now serious to Kyle as well.\n\n“I hear you, and I appreciate that you think so highly of me,” Kyle said, a teasing smile playing on his lips. “Let me chat with Nicole and Ryan over dinner tonight, and I’ll get back to you, okay? I’m confident we can work something out.”\n“I really appreciate it, man,” Luc said earnestly. “As a thank you for even considering it, feel free to use the gym here whenever you want. We don’t want you developing a dad bod, now do we?” he teased, giving Kyle’s stomach a playful pat. \n“Don’t you dare start that with me, you little sh—” Kyle retorted, unable to suppress a grin.\n\n“Got a meeting to run to!” Luc exclaimed, rising from the bleachers and jogging toward the coaches office before Kyle could finish his thought. “Keep that file tonight, just bring it back tomorrow. Love you!”\n“Yeah, yeah,” Kyle said, rolling his eyes with a chuckle.\nA mix of emotions stirred within Kyle as he found himself alone in the rink once more. The weight of the decision ahead loomed large, but he felt a flicker of hope. If there was a chance to make a difference for Declan, perhaps it was worth taking the leap.\nHe took a deep breath, glancing around the rink where memories flooded back once again: laughter, camaraderie, and the family he cherished. This new chapter was unfolding, a fresh purpose, and maybe it was finally time to embrace the unknown.\n\n“Okay, we’ve got two classic burgers, one club sandwich, and fries all around,” the waitress announced cheerfully as she placed each plate on the table with practiced ease. “Can I get you anything else?”\n“I think we’re all set, thanks, Jo,” Kyle said with a warm smile as he shifted his napkin onto his lap.\nThe Barnes family began digging in after the waitress left them to it. Ryan immediately reached for the ketchup and, true to form, drowned his fries in an absurd amount, completely unfazed by the amused glances from his parents.\nWithout a word, Kyle plucked the pickles from his burger and placed them on Ryan’s plate; a quiet ritual that had long become second nature. It was a small thing, but moments like that made Kyle feel grounded, like some parts of life hadn’t changed at all.\n\nThe table fell into a comfortable silence as everyone tucked into their meals, the clinking of silverware and the occasional satisfied hum filling the space between them. After a few minutes of quiet eating, Kyle leaned back slightly and broke the silence, ready to reconnect with his family.\n“Alright,” he hummed, taking a sip of his drink before setting the glass down. “Big day for all of us, huh? Who’s up first, anyone want to share?”\n”Oh, I’ll go,” Nicole said, her eyes lighting up. “As much as I love you, my beautiful boys, it was so nice to be back at the office today. Everyone was incredibly welcoming. Today was mostly administrative stuff, but we also talked through some upcoming projects, and I’m already itching to dive in.”\n\nKyle smiled, genuinely happy to see her so energized. “That’s awesome, babe. You’ve been waiting a long time for this.”\n“Yeah,” Ryan added between bites. “Mom’s finally getting to make other people’s houses look as cool as ours.”\n“Exactly!” Nicole cooed, giving Ryan’s bicep a soft pinch. “Though I do still expect your help moving samples around the garage, Mr. Muscles.”\nRyan groaned with a grin. “Knew that was coming.”\nKyle chuckled at their banter, then shifted in his seat, draping his arm around the back of Ryan’s chair so he could fully face him. As he moved, he gave the back of Ryan’s head a gentle scruff, earning a mock-annoyed eye roll from his son.\n\n“Alright, your turn, Champ. First day at St. Cassian’s, how’d it go?”\nRyan shrugged, poking at a fry. “It was alright.”\n“Just alright?” Nicole asked, raising an eyebrow. \n“I mean, it’s school. But the campus is pretty sick, and a couple of the guys on the team seemed cool. Classes weren’t bad either.”\nKyle nodded, his gaze steady. “That’s a solid start.”\nRyan gave another shrug, but this time it came with a small smile. “Yeah, I guess it wasn’t the worst first day.”\nKyle began rubbing a slow circle between Ryan’s shoulder blades absentmindedly, his gaze drifting to the window beside them. The sun was beginning to dip below the trees, casting golden streaks across the diner’s parking lot, a reminder of how quickly time was already passing.\n\n“Hey,” Kyle hummed, giving Ryan’s shoulder a light squeeze to catch his attention. “Tell your mom about practice. She’s been waiting all day to hear about it.”\nRyan perked up, his eyes brightening a little. “The rink’s insane, it’s like NHL-level. Uncle Luc- I mean, Coach Luc had us doing some light drills, mostly puck work and conditioning,” he said, trying to keep his voice even, though the excitement peeked through. \n“Yeah?” Nicole leaned in, genuinely curious. “Did it feel like the right fit?”\nRyan nodded. “Yeah. Everyone’s really good, but I think I held my own. Coach Luc kept it pretty easy on us for the first day, but I know it’s gonna ramp up fast.”\n\n“I’m so glad to hear that, baby,” Nicole said, reaching across the table to touch Ryan’s arm. Her fingers shifted, and she gave his chin a light tap with her knuckle. “Even if that smile in the picture your dad took this morning was, like, 40% effort at best.”\n“I smiled, didn’t I?” Ryan laughed, ducking his head. \n“Technically,” she teased, leaning back with a grin. “I have half a mind to make you retake it tomorrow.”\n“Nope,” Ryan said quickly, already shaking his head. “One per semester. That’s the rule.”\nKyle chuckled into his drink. “He’s been keeping track, apparently.”\n\nKyle watched the exchange with a quiet sense of contentment, the easy rhythm between Nicole and Ryan filling him with a familiar warmth. Then his gaze dropped to his plate, the weight of the earlier conversation with Luc nudging at the back of his mind. The time had come to shift gears.\nHe gave Nicole a small smile, then cleared his throat gently.\n“So, while we’re all sharing big firsts today,” Kyle began, his voice casual but deliberate, “there’s one more thing I wanted to run by you guys.”\nNicole looked up from her plate, brows knitting slightly with curiosity. “Everything okay?”\n\n“Yeah, yeah,” Kyle said quickly, waving a hand to ease the concern. “It’s nothing bad. Just…something Luc brought up this morning when I saw him at the rink.”\nRyan glanced up from his fries, picking up on the subtle shift in his dad’s tone. His posture straightened slightly, curiosity taking hold.\n“He asked me for a favor,” Kyle continued, glancing between them. “And it’s kind of a big one.”\nRyan raised an eyebrow, still chewing a fry. “Like, helping him move a couch kind of favor, or helping bury a body kind of favor?”\nNicole shot Ryan a disapproving look, but Kyle couldn’t help but chuckle. “It’s somewhere in between, I think.”\n\nRyan leaned back in his chair, taking a sip of his drink. “Okay, well now I’m really curious. What is it?” \nKyle shifted in his seat, removing his arm from the back of Ryan's chair and leaning forward slightly, resting his forearms on the table. “Luc asked if we’d consider being a billet family this season, for a new player joining the team.”\nNicole paused, setting down her glass with a thoughtful clink. “He wants us to take in a kid?” Her expression morphed, less surprise and more intrigue. “That’s definitely not something Luc would ask lightly.”\nKyle nodded. “Exactly. This kid, Declan Hull, he’s talented, no question. But his home life’s rocky. Luc thinks living with a stable family could really ground him.”\n\nRyan glanced between his parents, concern creeping into his expression. “Wait…does that mean he’d be, like, living with me? Am I going to have to share my room?” \nKyle met his eyes, offering a calm look to ease the concern. “He’ll be in the guest room, don’t worry. And honestly, part of why Luc thought of us is because he said you’d be a great example for him.”\nRyan leaned forward, mirroring his dad’s posture with his forearms on the table, his brows knitting together in thought. “Why wasn’t he at practice today then? If he’s on the team, shouldn’t he have started with the rest of us?”\n\nKyle nodded, understanding the question. He knew how important it was for a team to start the season together; same drills, same ice, building that early chemistry. \n“Luc said things came together really last minute, the paperwork just cleared. Declan gets in tomorrow, but he’s already locked in on the roster.”\nRyan tilted his head, clearly still processing. “Huh…that’s kind of wild. Just showing up outta nowhere.”\nKyle gently bumped his shoulder into Ryan’s, his voice steady. “Life isn’t always neat, Ry. This kid’s been bounced around for years, not because he’s a bad kid, but because no one’s given him a real chance. This might be his shot at something solid. So let’s not judge him before we even meet him, okay?”\n\nRyan pouted slightly at the soft scolding, his shoulders sinking just a bit. He looked down at his plate, quiet for a moment as he pushed a fry through the last streak of ketchup. \n“So he’s my age?” he asked, his voice more thoughtful now.\nKyle nodded. “Same grade. He’ll turn fifteen in May,” he said, watching Ryan closely for a reaction.\nBut nothing came. Ryan simply continued to eat the last of his fries, prompting Kyle to press on. “You okay with that?” he asked gently. “It’s a big shift, I know.”\nRyan shrugged, then nodded slowly. “I mean…yeah. I get it. If he really needs it, I’m not gonna be a jerk about it. Just gotta wrap my head around having a roommate now, I guess.”\n\nBefore Kyle could respond, Nicole quickly interjected. “If you weren’t okay with it, that wouldn’t make you a jerk, sweetheart. Do you understand? It’s natural to feel unsure, and you have the biggest heart I’ve ever seen, even when you try to hide it.”\nRyan gave a half-smile, eyes flicking toward his plate again.\nNicole glanced at Kyle, then back to Ryan. “And if this boy really needs a place to land, I think we’d be the right kind of home for him. It won’t be perfect, and it’ll probably take some adjusting, but we’ve got more to give. We always have.”\n\nShe looked at Kyle now, and his heart swelled. He reached for Nicole’s hand under the table and gave it a gentle squeeze.\n”I think it’s worth a shot, yeah?” Kyle nodded, his voice steady as he looked between the two of them. “But just so there’s no confusion, family comes first. It always has, and it always will.”\nNicole gave a small, knowing smile, and Ryan met his dad’s eyes, listening closely.\n“We’ll do our best to make this work,” Kyle continued, “but if it doesn’t feel right, if it’s too much or causes strain in the house, then we reassess. No guilt. No pressure. Just honesty.”\n\nHe paused for a beat. “But something tells me we might be exactly what this kid needs.”\nNicole reached for her water and nodded. “And maybe he’s exactly what we need too.”\nRyan leaned back in his seat, nudging his empty plate aside. “So…does finding out I’ve got a roommate now at least get me a to-go milkshake or something?”\nNicole raised an eyebrow, clearly amused. “Oh, we’re negotiating now?”\n“I mean, emotional growth is exhausting,” Ryan said with a grin. “I think I’ve earned some sugar.”\nKyle laughed, reaching for the check. “Fair enough. One chocolate milkshake, extra whipped cream. You definitely earned it.”\n\nAs they stood and gathered their things, the air around them felt lighter. They stepped out of the diner as one, Kyle’s arm draped protectively over Ryan’s shoulders, his other hand gently clasping Nicole’s.\nThere was still a lot unknown about what lay ahead, but they were facing it together.\nAnd that, Kyle thought, was more than a good start.\nThe house was quiet again. The kind of quiet that settles in only after a full day. Kyle padded barefoot down the hallway, coffee mug in one hand, Declan’s file tucked under his arm.\nThe bedroom light cast a warm glow across the sheets as Nicole emerged from the bathroom, brushing out the last bit of moisture from her hair. She wore one of Kyle’s old team t-shirts, the fabric soft and oversized, sleeves brushing her elbows.\n\nKyle was already propped up against the headboard when she climbed into bed beside him, pulling the covers over her lap with a contented sigh.\n“Ry asleep?” Nicole murmured, easing into his side, her fingers brushing lightly against his arm.\n“Mhm,” Kyle hummed, setting his mug down on the nightstand with a soft clink. The folder remained open on his lap, Declan’s profile page catching the soft pool of lamplight. Nicole’s gaze drifted to it.\n“You’ve read that three times already,” she said softly.\n“Yeah,” Kyle admitted, eyes still on the page. “I keep thinking about how young he looks. He’s just a kid. But there’s something in his eyes…I don’t know. It’s like he’s already carrying the weight of someone twice his age.”\n\nNicole leaned her head against his shoulder, her hand finding his on the file and resting there. “You’re already in it, huh?”\nKyle let out a breath through his nose; half a laugh, half a sigh. “I don’t know. Maybe. I just…I keep picturing what it would’ve been like for me at his age without my dad showing up to every game. Without someone giving a damn.”\nNicole was quiet for a moment, her thumb gently tracing his knuckles.\n“We’re good at giving a damn,” she said finally, her voice barely above a whisper.\nKyle turned to look at her, his expression soft. “You sure you’re up for this? Things were just starting to feel…balanced.”\n\n“I’m sure,” she said, meeting his eyes. “We’ve always made room when it mattered. This matters.”\n“And Ryan?” Kyle’s voice dipped, laced with quiet guilt. “I promised him this next chapter would be about him. More time together, just the two of us; his hockey, his moment. And now, day one, I’m asking him to share all of that with a complete stranger.”\n“What if it’s good for him too?” Nicole asked gently, her voice thoughtful. “Learning how to make space for someone else. Figuring out who he is not just on the ice, but as a teammate, a friend. Maybe even a brother.”\n\nKyle hadn’t considered that angle, not really. The idea settled over him slowly, unexpected but not unwelcome, like a shift in light that made the whole picture look different.\n“Damn,” Kyle murmured, a quiet smile tugging at his lips. “You’re good.”\nNicole grinned, tilting her head as she bumped her shoulder against his. “That’s why you married me, Barnes.”\n“Among a million other reasons,” he said, leaning over to press a kiss to her temple. “I love you.”\nShe smirked sleepily. “I love you too. Now turn off that light. We’ve got another big day tomorrow.” \nKyle chuckled, snapping the folder shut. He placed it gently on the nightstand beside his mug, then clicked off the lamp.\n\nAs darkness settled around them, he lay back beside her, one arm beneath her shoulders, the steady rhythm of her breathing already beginning to slow.\nAnd for a long while, Kyle stared at the ceiling, wide awake.\nTomorrow, everything would begin again. New roles. New routines. A new kid.\nA new chance.", "video": null, "screenshot": null, "prompt_instruction": "You are a professional English-to-Simplified Chinese translator, tasked with providing translations suitable for use in China (zh_CN).

”\n\n凯尔打断了他，帮他说下去。“你想让我们做他的寄宿家庭。”\n卢克认真地点了点头。“我亲眼看到你和妮可是怎么培养瑞恩的，看看他现在有多出色。如果德克兰也可以有个这样的家庭在背后支持他，他的人生很有可能会彻底改变。”\n凯尔沉思了一会。这不是简简单单做个人情，这是对另一位孩子负责。那天早上他收到卢克短信时，可没有料到后来会要考虑接一个小孩住进家里。尽管如此，他还是愿意为卢克做任何事，因为卢克眼中那份诚挚，让凯尔明白此事对他意义重大。那么现在这对自己也变得同样重要。\n\n“我知道了，我也感激你对我这么有信心。”凯尔边说嘴角边露出一丝调侃的微笑。“我吃晚饭时和妮可还有瑞恩聊聊，明天再给你答复，好吗？我相信我们会找到办法的。”\n“非常感谢你，哥们，”卢克真诚地说。“为了感谢你愿意考虑这件事，以后你可以随时来用这里的健身房。我们可不想你变成个大肚老爸，是不是?”他调侃道，随时拍了一下凯尔的肚子。\n“你敢这么跟我搞，你这个小混-”凯尔反驳道，同时也忍不住大笑起来。\n\n“现在要去开会啰！”卢克没等凯尔把话说完，就一边喊一边从条椅上起身往教练办公室跑了。“把文件带回家，每天再还我。爱你!”\n“好好。”凯尔笑着翻了个白眼说。\n当凯尔再次发现自己孤零零一人留在冰场中时，内心开始百感交集。这将是个非常重大的决定，但他同时也感到了那么一丝希望。如果有可能让德克兰改变人生，也许值得一试。\n他深吸了一口气，再次环顾冰场，那些美好的回忆再次重现：欢笑、友谊，还有他珍爱的家人。一页新的篇章正在展开，一个全新的目标出现在眼前，也许，是到真正拥抱未知的时刻了。\n\n“好，咱们点了两份经典汉堡，一份俱乐部三明治，还有薯条搭配。”女招待一边欢快地宣布一边熟练地把餐盘摆上桌。“你们还需要点什么吗？”\n“我们就点这些啦，谢谢你，乔，”凯尔边把餐巾铺在膝上边微笑着回应。\n女招待离开后，巴恩斯一家开始用餐。瑞恩立刻抓起番茄酱瓶猛捏，像往常一样把薯条都淹没在番茄酱中，全然不顾父母投来好笑的眼光。\n什么也没说，凯尔把汉堡里的腌黄瓜挑了出来，放到瑞恩盘子里；这是他俩之间一个默认的小仪式，已经是个习惯了。这是仅件小事，但是像这样的时刻往往让凯尔觉得生活中有些东西总是那么一成不变。\n\n餐桌被一片温馨的宁静包裹着，因为每人都在专心用餐，只听得见刀叉碰触餐盘的声响，和偶尔传出的满足的哼哼声。吃了几分钟，凯尔稍微往后一靠，打破沉默，准备和家人交流交流。\n“好，”他哼了声，抿了口饮料，然后把杯子放下。“很忙的一天，是不是？谁先来，说说今天的经历？”\n“哦，我先，”妮可回应道，她的双眼在放光。“虽然我很爱你们，帅哥们，但今天能回去工作真是太棒啦。每个人都那么热情。今天主要是一些行政的东西，但我们还是讨论了几个就要开始的项目，我已经心痒痒想要投入进去啦。”\n\n凯尔笑了，真为她的精力充沛感到开心。“那太棒了，亲爱的。你等这一刻等了很久。”\n“是啊，”瑞恩边吃边附和。“老妈终于可以让别人家也和我们的一样酷了。””\n“没错！”妮可柔声说道，然后在瑞恩的手臂上轻捏了下。“尽管如此，我还是希望你能帮忙搬一搬车库里的样品，肌肉先生。”\n瑞恩龇牙一笑，咕哝了一声。“就知道你要说这个。”\n凯尔被两人之间的小玩笑逗乐，然后在椅子上挪了一下，把手臂搭在了瑞恩的椅背上，这样可以完全面对着他。还顺势抓了下他的头，瑞恩还了个假装嫌弃的白眼。\n\n“好啦，到你说了，冠军。圣卡西安的第一天，过得怎么样？”\n瑞恩耸耸肩，戳着根薯条。“还行吧。”\n“只是还行而已？”妮可扬着眉毛问到。\n“是啊，它是间学校。但校区很酷，队里几个人挺不错的。课堂也还行。”\n凯尔点点头，认真地看着他。“这是一个很好的开端。”\n瑞恩再次耸耸肩，不过这次他带着微笑。“是的，我想这起码不是最糟的开学日。”\n凯尔开始有点心不在焉地在瑞恩的两个肩骨之间画圈圈，然后他的目光飘到了旁边的窗户外。太阳开始下山了，在森林后面透射出一缕缕金光，把餐馆停车场染上一层金黄色。这也提醒凯尔，时间正在飞逝。\n\n“嗨，”凯尔轻声说，轻轻捏了下瑞恩的肩膀引起他注意。“跟你妈说说你训练的事。她等了一整天想听你说这个。”\n瑞恩精神一振，眼睛顿时亮了起来。“学校的冰场太强啦，感觉就是国家冰球联盟的档次。卢克叔 - 我是说卢克教练,他让我们做了些轻度练习，基本上是冰球相关的体能训练。”他说道同时尽量保持语气平缓，尽管他的兴奋情绪还是溢于言表。\n“是吗？”妮可侧身过来，满是好奇。“感觉和大家合得来吗？”\n瑞恩点点头。“合得来。大家都很强，但我觉得自己坚持得不错。卢克教练第一天对我们还是挺客气的，但我知道强度马上就会加大。”\n\n“听你这么讲我非常高兴，宝贝。”妮可边说边伸手越过桌子碰了下瑞恩的手臂。她手指向上一动，然后用指节轻轻弹了弹他下巴。“不过你爸爸早上拍的那张照片你的笑脸，最多也就40%的配合度吧。”\n“起码我还是笑了，不是吗？”瑞恩低下头哈哈大笑。\n“严格来说是的，”她调侃道，然后往后靠去，面露笑容。“我还在想是不是让你明天重拍一张了。”\n“才不要啦，”瑞恩马上接上，立刻摇头。“每学期只能一张，这是规矩。”\n凯尔咯咯笑了，然后去拿他的饮料。“很明显，他一直记着呢。”\n\n凯尔心满意足地看着母子的对话，妮可和瑞恩间那种轻松的气让一如既往地让他觉得温暖。然后，他低头看着自己的盘子，早上和卢克的重要对话浮现在脑海里。该转话题了。\n他对妮可微笑了下，然后清了清嗓子。\n“那么，既然我们大家都分享了自己重要的第一天，”凯尔开始说，尽量让语气轻松，“但我还有一件事想和你们说说。”\n妮可抬起头，眉头好奇地微微皱起。“一切还好吗？”\n\n“还好，还好”凯尔连忙说，挥挥手想让她放心。“不是坏事。只是……我早上在冰场见卢克时，他提了件事。”\n瑞恩把目光从薯条上挪开，抬眼看了过来，他感觉到了父亲语气上细微的变化。他的坐姿也因好奇心不由自主稍微挺直了一点。\n“他请我帮个忙。”凯尔继续说，目光从两人间扫过。“是个大忙。”\n瑞恩扬起眉毛，嘴里还嚼着薯条。“是那种帮他搬沙发的忙，还是帮他埋尸体的忙？”\n妮可不满地瞪了瑞恩一眼，但是凯尔却忍不住笑起来。“差不多是介于这两者之间吧，我想。”\n\n瑞恩靠回到椅背上，喝了口饮料。“好吧，现在我真的好奇了。是什么事？”\n凯尔在他座位上换了个姿势，把搭在瑞恩椅背上的手挪开来，身体稍微前倾，把两前臂搭在桌面上。“有个新球员加入球队，卢克问我们能不能考虑这个赛季当他的寄宿家庭。”\n妮可停住了，放下杯子，杯底叮当一响碰到了桌面。“他是想让我们收留个孩子？”她的表情变了，不完全是惊讶，更多是好奇。“卢克绝不会随便提出这种人情的。”\n凯尔点点头。“没错。这孩子叫德克兰.赫尔，非常有天赋，毋庸置疑。但他的家庭状况不好。卢克认为，如果能住到一个稳定的家庭里，就能帮他打好基础。”\n\n瑞恩来回瞟瞟父母，脸上出现一丝担忧。“等下……那是不是说，他要跟我一起住？我要和别人分享我的卧室吗？”\n凯尔和儿子的目光交汇，平静地看了他一眼，想缓解他的情绪。“他会用客房，别担心。但说实话，卢克之所以想到我们，是因为觉得你会成为他的好榜样。”\n瑞恩身体前倾，和他父亲一样双臂搭在桌子上，眉头紧锁思索着。“那他今天为什么没来训练？如果他是队员，他不是应该和我们一块开始训练才对吗？”\n\n凯尔点点头，明白这是个重要的问题。他知道球队在赛季开始一起训练，用同样的训练方式、用同样的场地，这对在早期就建立默契至关重要。\n“卢克说在最后一刻事情才被处理好，文件也才在今天批下来。德克兰明天才到，但他已经确定上了训练日程表。”\n瑞恩歪着头，显然还在消化这个消息。“嗯……这有点突然。突然蹦出个人来。”\n凯尔用肩膀轻轻碰了下瑞恩的肩膀，语气平静。“生活不总是一帆风顺的，小瑞。这个孩子这些年来被踢来踢去，而这并不是因为他不好，是没人真正给过他一次机会。这可能是他唯一获得稳定生活的机会。因此在没和他见面前，让我们先不要下结论，好吗？”\n\n瑞恩听到这温和的教导，微微撅了撅嘴，肩膀塌下来一点。他低头看着自己的盘子，沉默了会，用根薯条划盘子上的最后一点番茄酱。\n“那， 他和我一样大吗？”现在他用思考的语气问道。\n凯尔点点头。“和你同年级。他五月就满十五岁。”他边说边仔细观察瑞恩的反应。\n但没看到什么反应。瑞恩只是继续在吃最后几根薯条。这让凯尔追问。“你真没意见吗？”他温和地问。“我知道这是个大变化。”\n瑞恩耸耸肩，慢慢地点了点头。“嗯……是的。我知道你的意思。如果他真需要帮助，我也不想显得太自私。我猜，我只是得慢慢适应多了个室友这件事。”\n\n凯尔还没来得及说什么，妮可就插话了。“亲爱的，你不愿意也没事，这也不会让你变成一个坏人。明白吗？你感到不确定是很正常的。而你有着我见过的最宽广的心胸，即便你不把它表露出来。”\n瑞恩露出微笑，眼睛再次快速落在自己的盘子上。\n妮可瞟了凯尔一眼，然后又看向瑞恩。“如果这个孩子真需要个落脚点，我觉得我们家是不错的。不会十全十美，可能会有个调整期，但我们总是愿意帮忙。我们一贯如此。”\n\n她现在注视着凯尔，让他心里非常激动。他在桌下握着妮可的手，轻轻一捏。\n“我想这值得我们试试，对不对？”凯尔点点头，看着他俩，语气坚定。“但要说清楚，家人永远第一位。历来如此，以后也一样。”\n妮可给出一个认可的微笑。瑞恩看着父亲，认真听他讲。\n“我们会尽力帮忙。”凯尔接着说，“但如果感觉不对，或者负担太重，或者这对家庭造成了太大压力，那我们就得重新评估。不要有罪恶感，不要有压力，只坦诚相见。”\n\n他停了下。“但我总觉得，我们家庭或许正是这孩子需要的。”\n妮可伸手去拿水杯，然后点点头。“说不定他也是我们正需要的。”\n瑞恩靠回到椅背，把空盘子推开。“那么^现在知道我会有个室友了，是不是起码该给我买个外带奶昔什么的？”\n妮可挑起眉，显然被逗乐了。“啊，现在开始谈条件了吗？”\n“我的意思是，情感成长太累人了。”瑞恩咧嘴一笑，“我觉得得补充一点糖分。”\n凯尔笑着拿起账单。“明白。一杯巧克力奶昔，加双倍奶油。这绝对是你应得的。”\n\n他们站起来，拿好自己的东西，周围的空气仿佛轻松了不少。他们一道走出餐馆，凯尔的一只手搭在瑞恩的肩上护着他，另一只手温柔握着妮可的手。\n前方还有许多未知，但他们会共同面对。\n对凯尔来说，这不仅仅是个好的开端。\n宁静再一次笼罩着房子。这种宁静只会在充实的一天后出现。凯尔光着脚走在走廊上，一手拿着咖啡，把德克兰的资料夹在他另一个胳膊下。\n卧室的柔光洒在床单上。妮可正从浴室出来，把湿发擦干。她穿着凯尔昔日球队的T恤，布料松软，宽大的袖口垂到了她的手肘。\n\n凯尔正靠在床头坐着，她爬上床躺到他身旁，把被子拉过盖在双腿，舒适地呼了口气。\n“小瑞睡了吗？”妮可低声问，缓缓靠过来，手指轻拂他的手臂。\n“睡了。”凯尔轻哼，把杯子放到床头柜上，轻轻发出了叮当一声。打开的文件夹摊放在他腿上，台灯的柔光照在德克兰的资料页上。妮可的目光飘向资料。\n“你都读三遍了。”她轻声说。\n“是啊。”凯尔承认，眼睛还盯着资料。“我一直在想，他看上去真的好年轻。真的只是个孩子。但他的眼里有种东西……我说不上来。就像他已经肩负着不属于他这个年纪的重担。”\n\n妮可把头靠在他肩上，手搭在了他搁在资料的手上。“你已经完全投入这件事了，是吧？”\n凯尔鼻子里呼出了一口气，半笑半叹息。“我不清楚。也许吧。我只是……我一直在想，要是我小时候我父亲从不来看我的比赛，从没有人真正在意我。”\n妮可沉默了一会，她的拇指轻轻移在他指节上。\n“我们在管闲事这方面都挺擅长的。”她最后说，声音低如耳语。\n凯尔转头看她，神情温柔。“你确定你也准备好了吗？一切好不容易才开始.……恢复平衡。”\n\n“我确定。”她看着他的眼睛说。“我们总是会为要紧的事腾出空间。这回也一样。”\n“那瑞恩呢？”凯尔的声音低了下来，带着一丝愧疚。“我答应过他，这个新阶段归他独有。我俩会花更多时间在一起，一起打冰球，时间都给他。可现在，才第一天，我就要他跟个陌生人分享这一切。”\n“说不定这对他是件好事。”妮可用深思熟虑的语气温和地说道。“学会为他人腾出空间。不仅仅是在冰场上了解他，而且还把他作为队友、朋友。甚至兄弟。\n\n凯尔还没从那个角度想过。不过，现在这个主意慢慢占据着他的思绪，就像当光的角度发生变化时，一切景象都会随之改变，这虽意外，但不令人排斥。\n“哎……”凯尔咕哝着，嘴角露出微笑。“你真厉害。”\n妮可咧嘴笑了，撞了撞他肩膀，歪着头。“这就是你娶我的原因，巴恩斯先生。”\n“还有另外一百万个原因。”他说着，低头在她太阳穴上亲了下。“我爱你。”\n她半眯着眼睛得意地笑。“我也爱你。现在把那灯关了。明天还有大事呢。”\n凯尔轻笑着合上文件夹。轻轻放到他床头柜上的杯子旁，然后关掉了台灯。\n\n黑暗中，他躺回她身边，一只手臂绕过她的肩。她的呼吸节奏逐渐平缓。\n而他盯着天花板看了许久，毫无睡意。\n明天，一切将重新开始。新角色。新日常。新来的孩子。\n新希望"}}}

His headphones rested around his neck, the music paused a while ago, but he hadn’t noticed. He’d spent the last hour watching pine trees blur past the window, wondering if this place would be like the others.\n\nTemporary.\nWith a slow exhale, Declan rose to his feet, slinging the duffel bag over his shoulder. The blue canvas was stiff and new, the St. Cassian’s crest embroidered in gold on the side. It had been overnighted to him in anticipation for his arrival, along with his class uniform and team-issued hockey sweats. He’d conveniently ignored the uniform, pulling on the sweats instead. After seven hours crammed on a bus from Syracuse, he dared someone to say a word about him showing up late and out of dress code. \nThe driver gave him a brief nod as he stepped off the bus.\n\nThe fall air was colder than he expected, brisk and sharp as it hit his lungs. He zipped his windbreaker up higher and adjusted his grip on the bag. His eyes scanned the wide campus, tracing the stone buildings and manicured lawns with casual disinterest until they landed on the rink in the distance.\nThere it was. The reason he was here.\nHockey was the one thing that always made sense, even when everything else didn’t.\nOn the ice, he was free. He could move how he wanted, think how he wanted, and he was good . Nothing else in his life had ever been that simple.\n\nHe shifted his bag higher on his shoulder, drawn toward the rink like muscle memory. His feet started moving without him even really deciding to. Then a voice snapped him out of it.\n“Excuse me, sweetheart! New arrival?”\nAn older woman in a St. Cassian’s blazer was waving him down from the main entrance, clipboard in hand and a no-nonsense energy that made him stop in his tracks.\n“Uh, yeah,” he said, squinting against the sun. “I’m Declan. Declan Hull.”\n“Oh, hi, Declan.” She smiled as she caught up to him, a little out of breath but friendly. “I’m Heather Burke, Director of Admissions.” She extended her hand with practiced warmth, like she’d done this a hundred times before.\n\n“Hi,” Declan said, reaching out to shake her hand. His grip was firm, but quick; polite enough, though his eyes kept drifting back toward the rink.\nShe noticed the way his gaze kept pulling back to the rink and smiled knowingly.\n“You’re ready to get after it, aren’t you?” she said with a spark of encouragement. “Well, no point in delaying. I know your coaches are looking forward to meeting you. Shall we?”\nShe turned, already walking toward the rink, trusting he’d follow.\nDeclan didn’t say a word, just adjusted his grip on the duffel and fell in step, eyes fixed straight ahead.\n\n”So,” she hummed, breaking the silence, “you missed the first two days of classes. I’ve got all your classwork and homework here.” \nShe handed him a folder as they walked; blue and gold, stamped with the school crest in shiny foil. Declan almost rolled his eyes. Even the homework was branded.\n“Normally, we have a zero-tolerance policy for late work,” she continued. “But given the circumstances, you’ll have until the end of the week to get it turned in. If you need a tutor to help you catch up, that can be arranged.”\nDeclan’s brain buzzed, already overloaded by the flood of expectations and deadlines. Heather must’ve picked up on it. She gave him a brief pat on the back, like that would somehow make it better.\n\n\"Don’t worry, everything you need to know is in the school handbook,\" she said, her tone casual, as though she was well-accustomed to the overwhelmed look on new students’ faces.\nRight . The endless handbook they emailed over. As if he’d actually sit down and read all that.\nBefore Declan’s brain could short-circuit from the overload, Heather pushed open the doors to the rink. The blast of cold air hit him like a welcome shock, instantly calming the chaos in his head.\nFinally. \n“Coach Benoit’s office is just through here,” Heather said, leading him down the hallway. \nShe knocked on the door, and it swung open immediately. The man who stepped into view was the same one from the school website photo, his broad smile instantly recognizable. He beamed at Declan like an old friend.\n\n“Declan!” he exclaimed with enthusiasm, his smile widening. “Welcome to St. Cassian’s. How was the ride in?”\n“Long,” Declan said with a shrug, the weight of the journey still lingering in his voice. “But I’m just glad to finally be here.”\nLuc stepped forward with a confident handshake, his grip firm but welcoming. “We’re thrilled to have you on board.” He turned to Heather with a smile. “Mrs. Burke, thank you for making the trek out to The Den.”\nShe waved him off with an easy smile. “Anytime. If you need me, you know where to find me.” With a final nod, she turned and swept out, her heels clicking in steady rhythm across the rink floor.\n\n“Come on in, Declan,” Luc said as he opened the door and stepped aside to let him through.\nDeclan walked in but hesitated a few steps past the threshold. His gaze landed on a man already in the room, someone he recognized. His posture stiffened.\n”Whoa, wait. You’re Kyle Barnes,” Declan said, the corners of his mouth lifting for the first time all day. The weight of the bus ride, the nerves, the folder full of homework gone for a moment.\nKyle’s smile was easy, confident. He stepped forward and extended a hand.\n“Nice to meet you, Declan. I’ve heard a lot about you.”\n\nDeclan shook his hand, barely keeping the awe off his face. A breath slipped out, half disbelief, half nerves, and before he could stop himself, his mouth got ahead of his brain.\n“I had you on my fantasy team last year. Not gonna lie, you lost me the championship.”\nDeclan pressed his lips together the second the words left his mouth, the grin fading as panic crept in. Nice one, he thought. Way to chirp an NHL vet five minutes into meeting him. He resisted the urge to bury his face in his hands.\nA snicker sounded behind him. Declan glanced over his shoulder to see Coach Luc with a hand half-covering his mouth, doing a poor job of hiding his amusement. \n\nKyle nodded, the corners of his mouth twitching as he fought back a smile. “Is that right? Sorry to let you down. Guess it’s a good thing I hung up the skates when I did, spare a few more fantasy teams the heartbreak.”\nDeclan opened his mouth, then quickly shut it again, heat creeping up the back of his neck. “I mean…your Cup run with the Kings was insane, though. That game seven OT goal? Unreal.” He scratched the back of his neck. “So… uh, what are you doing at St. Cassian’s? Are you coaching here now? I didn’t see you on the website.”\n\nLuc settled into his chair, the leather creaking softly as he leaned back, then gestured to the seat across from him. “That’s actually what we wanted to talk to you about.”\nDeclan dropped into the chair, his duffel still slung across one shoulder, curiosity flickering behind his eyes. He wasn’t sure what he expected, but something about Luc’s tone made him sit a little straighter.\nLuc leaned forward, resting his forearms on the desk, his tone shifting; slower now, more deliberate. He glanced over at Kyle, then back to Declan.\n“Coming to a new school like St. Cassian’s is no small thing. You’re stepping into a new environment, away from home, with big expectations; on the ice, in the classroom, socially. That’s a lot for anyone, even a kid with your talent.”\n\nHe let the words breathe for a moment, letting them land before continuing.\n“When we found out you’d be joining us, one of the first conversations we had was about how to make that transition easier for you. Where you’d land. Who you’d be around. Not just where you sleep at night, but where you’d feel like you had solid ground beneath you.”\nLuc nodded toward Kyle. “Kyle and his family moved here this summer. His son, Ryan, is one of your new teammates. His wife, Nicole, she’s the kind of person who makes a place feel like home the second you walk in. And Kyle? Well, you know who he is.”\n\nHe paused again, not for dramatic effect, but because it mattered.\n“He’s not on the coaching staff, at least not officially. But he’s part of something new we’re building here. A different kind of support system; player development, mentorship, leadership off the ice as much as on. And we want you to be part of that.”\nLuc’s smile came easy, a little crooked. “So, here’s the offer: Kyle and his family have opened their home to you. If you’re open to it, we think it’s a great fit. But no pressure. We wanted to bring it to you first.”\nDeclan blinked, caught off guard. He hadn’t expected this. At all.\n\nEvery boarding school he’d been to had followed the same formula; dorms, roommates, shared bathrooms, and noise. This? Living off-campus? With a former NHL player and his family? That was…new. \nHe glanced between Luc and Kyle, trying to read between the lines, to figure out if this was really optional or just dressed up to feel that way.\n“I thought I’d be living on campus,” he said finally, his voice quieter, not confrontational, just honest.\nLuc nodded, like he’d anticipated that reaction. “Totally fair. And yeah, most students do. But with your background, and the level we expect you to compete at, we wanted to try something a little different. Give you a foundation.”\n\nDeclan shifted in his seat, still trying to wrap his head around it. Living with Kyle Barnes. Having breakfast across the table from the guy who used to light it up in the league. It was a lot to take in.\nKyle let out a soft chuckle, picking up on the hesitation in Declan’s eyes. “It’s a lot to process, huh?”\nDeclan didn’t answer, but the look on his face said enough. He watched Kyle carefully, the weight of it all pressing in.\nKyle leaned back in his chair, settling into a more relaxed posture, but his eyes stayed sharp and knowing. “I’ve been where you’re sitting. New town. New team. Big pressure. It can mess with your head if you let it.”\n\nDeclan’s mind flickered through every worry he’d been carrying since stepping off that bus. Was Kyle reading him that easily? It felt like he was peeling back layers without even trying. That low, familiar buzz of uncertainty crept up again, and somehow, Kyle seemed to catch it without a word.\n“I know it’s not easy, kid.” Kyle gave a small, almost fatherly sigh. His voice was lower now; gentle, but steady. “But here’s the thing. If you stay with us, you’re not just crashing at a billet house. I’m offering you space to breathe. A place to land when everything else feels like it’s spinning.”\n\nDeclan felt his throat tighten. Like the room had gone still for a second.\n“Hockey’s a hell of a ride,” Kyle went on, “and yeah, I’ll push you. But I’ll have your back every step of the way. This isn’t just about stats or ice time, it’s about becoming the kind of player, the kind of person, who can handle the long haul. And I’ve been through the trenches. I know what that takes.”\nHe folded his arms casually, the edge in his voice softening into something more inviting. “It’s a big decision, I get that. So here’s what I’m thinking, you crash with us tonight. No pressure. See the house, meet Nicole and Ryan. Feel it out. Then tomorrow, if it feels right, we’ll talk.”\n\nDeclan didn’t even realize he was nodding until the motion was halfway done.\nSomething about the way Kyle spoke; calm, direct, like he actually got it. It cut through the usual static in Declan’s brain. He didn’t know what was happening, not really. Just that, for some reason, this guy already had a kind of hold on him. Not in a forced way. Just…steady. Solid. Like someone who meant what he said and wouldn’t flake the second things got hard.\nNo adult had ever made him feel that before. Not a teacher. Not a coach. Not even his own dad. \n\nSo yeah, maybe he wasn’t sure about any of this, but his head kept nodding anyway.\n“Okay,” he said finally. “I’ll give it a shot.”\nLuc and Kyle exchanged a quick smile, something quiet and satisfied passing between them.\n\"Great!\" Luc said, his enthusiasm palpable. He leaned forward, a spark in his eyes. \"Any questions or anything on your mind before you head out to practice?\"\nDeclan paused, the question hanging in the air for a moment. He glanced between Luc and Kyle, then shook his head. \"I think I’m good for now.\"\n\"Alright, go ahead and get settled in,\" Luc said, standing up and motioning toward the hallway. \"Locker room's down the hall to the right. Your name’s on one of the stalls, and your gear's already waiting for you.\"\n\nDeclan rose to his feet, clutching the duffel a little tighter.\nLuc gave him a nod. “Practice starts in twenty. Coach Reynolds will meet you on the ice.”\nKyle stood too, that same calm energy still radiating off him. “I’ll see you after. Nicole’s making chicken parm tonight. Hope you’re hungry.”\nDeclan gave a half-smile without meaning to. “Yeah. Sounds good.”\nAnd with that, he turned and headed for the hallway, trying not to overthink the million things racing through his head.\nPractice flew by in a blur of crisp passes, sharp turns, and the unmistakable rush that only came when his skates hit fresh ice. Declan didn’t need time to adjust to that, his instincts kicked in from the first drill. It wasn’t long before heads were turning and quiet nods of approval passed between coaches.\n\nIt felt good. Easy. Like slipping into something that had always fit.\nThe locker room buzzed with post-practice energy; snapping tape, the thud of gear hitting benches, and a steady stream of chirps flying from stall to stall.\n“Not bad for the new guy,” one of the defensemen called, grinning as he peeled off his jersey. \nDeclan smirked as he unstrapped his pads. “Figured I’d show up, impress a little, then humble you tomorrow.”\nA few guys let out loud “Oooohs,” one of them chucking a rolled-up sock at him.\nAs he dodged the sock, Declan caught Ryan watching him from across the room. Not in a hostile way, just…quietly. Studying. Like he was still deciding what to make of him.\n\nBefore Declan could read into it, Ryan stood, tugged his hoodie over damp hair, and headed out without a word.\nThe rest of the guys were still laughing and joking around, but that moment stuck.\nDeclan finished peeling off his gear and slung the duffel over his shoulder. When he stepped out into the hallway, he spotted them; Kyle and Ryan, standing just outside the rink doors. Kyle’s hand rested on his son’s shoulder, his voice low and calm, the kind of tone only a dad could pull off.\nRyan nodded at something, eyes on the ground. Declan didn’t catch what was said, but he could tell instantly that they were close. Really close.\n\nIt hit him in a way he didn’t expect.\nKyle glanced up and spotted Declan, a smile already forming as he lifted a hand in an easy wave. “There he is. You survive your first Coach Luc practice?”\nDeclan nodded, catching up to them. “Barely,” he said, though the grin tugging at the corner of his mouth gave him away.\nRyan gave him a short glance, but didn’t say much. Just gave a subtle nod, then walked ahead toward the parking lot.\n“Come on,” Kyle said, clapping a hand gently on Declan’s back. “Let’s get you home.”\nHome. The word sounded weird in his head. But as he followed them to the car, something in his chest loosened, just a little.\n\nThe car ride was quiet in a way Declan hadn’t realized he’d been craving. No one asked him questions or tried to fill the silence with small talk. Ryan had earbuds in, staring out his window. Kyle kept one hand on the wheel, the other resting casually on the console, humming now and then to the classic rock playing softly through the speakers.\nDeclan leaned his head against the window and watched the world roll by. The narrow roads wound through thick trees brushed with the first touches of fall; burnt oranges, deep reds, and gold. It was nothing like the city. The quiet felt intentional here. Peaceful.\n\nHe hadn’t noticed any of this from the bus, just the ache in his back and the buzz of nerves. But now…now it didn’t seem so bad.\nThe car turned off the main road and onto a quiet, tree-lined street, the tires humming softly against the worn asphalt. Declan glanced out the window, taking in the quaint homes tucked into the hillsides, most with wide porches and tidy yards. Everything felt still out here, like the whole world had taken a breath and held it.\nThey pulled into a modest driveway in front of a two-story house with deep blue siding and white trim. Warm yellow light glowed from the windows, casting a soft welcome as twilight settled over the neighborhood.\n\nKyle eased the car into park, the soft hum of the engine cutting through the quiet of the evening. He turned to look at Declan with a small smile. “This is us. Home sweet home,” he said, his tone light but with a quiet certainty, as if he were laying down an unspoken promise.\nDeclan didn’t answer, but he opened the door and stepped out. The air smelled faintly of pine and chimney smoke. Calmer than anything he’d felt in weeks.\nRyan was already unlocking the front door, his silhouette framed by the porch light.\nKyle gave Declan’s shoulder a gentle tap before heading up the steps. “Come on. Nicole’s got dinner waiting, and she’s been asking about you all day.”\n\nThe door swung open with a quiet creak, and warm air spilled out into the cool evening, carrying the unmistakable smell of garlic and tomato sauce. Declan stepped inside behind Kyle, the hardwood floors smooth under his sneakers and the house glowing with soft, ambient light that gave it a lived-in, welcoming feel.\n“Hi!” a voice called from the kitchen. A moment later, a woman stepped out, wiping her hands on a dish towel. She was tall, athletic, with a sharp but warm energy that instantly filled the space. “You must be Declan.”\nDeclan hesitated for a moment, caught in the awkwardness of the moment. He nodded, unsure whether to wave or offer a handshake, his mind scrambling for a response. “Uh, yeah. Hi.”\n\nBefore he could say anything else, Nicole stepped forward, her arms open in a welcoming embrace. She pulled him into a hug without missing a beat.\n“It’s so nice to meet you!” she said, rubbing his back gently in a motherly way before pulling back from the hug. “I’m Nicole. Hope you’re hungry, I made chicken parm. It’s a family favorite.”\n“Yeah…starving, actually.”\nRyan had already disappeared upstairs, his footsteps fading above them, leaving the three of them in the open kitchen and living room. Declan took in the house. Family photos lined the walls, the dining table was half-set, and the smell from the kitchen was enough to make his stomach growl. Everything felt grounded, like people lived here and liked living here.\n\nNicole gestured toward a stool at the island. “Sit, relax. Dinner’ll be ready in a few. Any food allergies I should know about?”\n“Nope.”\nKyle was already pulling plates from the cabinet. “He held his own at practice,” he said casually over his shoulder, like it was no big deal.\nNicole raised a brow at Declan. “Impressive. First day and already showing off?”\nHe shrugged, a flicker of pride sneaking into his chest. “Just trying to keep up.”\nIt felt…comfortable in a way he hadn’t expected. Like maybe, for once, he wouldn’t have to brace himself all the time.\nBy the time they sat down for dinner, that feeling hadn't gone away.\n\nDeclan hesitated only for a second before sliding into his seat next to Ryan, who was already digging in like it was a competitive sport. He glanced at his own portion and, after a quick taste, instantly understood why. The chicken parm was insanely good.\nDeclan took another bite, savoring the perfect balance of crispy breading and rich marinara. The flavors were way better than he expected, so much so that he couldn't help but mutter, “This is fucking good.”\nThe second the words left his mouth, the room fell dead silent. Ryan’s fork froze halfway to his mouth, his eyes snapping up to Declan with a mixture of shock and disbelief, like Declan had just unleashed a bomb at the dinner table. \n\nDeclan, unaware of the shift, continued chewing, casually glancing around the table, still absorbed in the taste of his food.\nThen he noticed it. The tension. The quiet.\nKyle’s voice broke the silence, calm but carrying an unmistakable authority. “Declan,” he said, his tone measured. “We don’t use that kind of language, especially not at the dinner table.”\nDeclan blinked, caught off guard. “Oh. Um, we...we’re hockey players though,” he shrugged, trying to brush it off. “It's kind of part of the deal.”\nKyle didn’t smile. His face remained impassive, though there was a flicker of something in his eyes, a reminder that this wasn’t some casual request. “Maybe on the ice, yeah, but even then, you’re too young for that kind of talk.”\n\nDeclan’s brow furrowed, his words tripping over themselves. “You- what?”\nKyle’s gaze was steady, never wavering. “In this house, we keep it clean. We respect the people we’re around.”\nDeclan's confusion was evident as he leaned over to Ryan, lowering his voice. “You don’t talk like that?” he asked, genuinely curious, not sure what to make of it all.\nBefore Ryan could answer, Nicole's voice rang out, light but firm. “Not if he doesn’t want soap in his mouth.”\nRyan’s eyes widened comically, panic creeping into his voice. “Mom!”\nNicole didn’t bat an eye. “Just saying,” she added with a knowing smirk.\n\nDeclan’s chest tightened. Soap in his mouth? Was she serious? He shot a look toward Kyle, but there was no humor in his eyes, just a quiet, resolute discipline.\nKyle cleared his throat and leaned back, his expression softening just enough to show he wasn’t angry, but he wasn’t backing down either. \n“Look, we get it. Hockey culture, the locker room, it’s different. We don’t mind a little edge when it's warranted, but when you're in my house, there are lines we don’t cross.” He gave Declan a pointed look, making sure the weight of the words settled. “You’re not just here to play hockey, you’re here to grow. And that means learning discipline, both on and off the ice.”\n\nDeclan couldn’t deny the way those words landed on him. His gut twisted a little, not from anger, but from something else. It wasn’t exactly comfort , but maybe that’s what he needed: boundaries. \nRyan eyed him again, his face unreadable now, like he was sizing Declan up all over again. Nicole, on the other hand, was already back to plating up another round of food, acting like nothing had happened. But Declan could tell, this family didn’t mess around.\nDeclan let out a small exhale, unsure what to say. “Yeah, sure. Sorry about that.” \nHe leaned back in his chair and stared at his plate, trying to collect his thoughts. The sudden shift in atmosphere threw him off. \n\nKyle nodded, his voice softening again, but still carrying that same steady cadence. “It’s okay.” His mouth quirked in reassurance. “Alright. Now, eat up.”\nDeclan met Kyle’s gaze. He nodded, offering a sheepish grin. \nRyan, still eyeing him like he’d just seen a rare species, let out a quiet sigh and turned his attention back to his food. Kyle gave Ryan a look that was all too familiar, a mix of casual suggestion and quiet command. \n“Hey, after dinner why don’t you help Declan get started on his homework?”\nRyan immediately groaned, his fork clattering against his plate. “I’m not a tutor.”\n\nKyle didn’t flinch. He just raised his eyebrows, the eyebrows, stern but patient. The kind that said: You sure about that answer, kid?\nRyan deflated with a dramatic sigh, like he’d just been asked to scrub the entire rink with a toothbrush. “Dad, come on, I’ve got my own homework to finish. And I’m seriously wiped out.” He slouched even further, practically melting into his seat.\nBefore the tension could stretch any further, Declan spoke up, casually throwing Ryan a lifeline. “It’s fine. Mrs. Burke said I could get a tutor or something to catch up. No big deal.”\nKyle kept an eyebrow raised at Ryan, then looked back at Declan with a nod. “That works. We’ll talk to the school tomorrow, get someone lined up for you.”\n\nRyan shot Declan a look, something between surprised and quietly grateful. He didn’t say thank you, but his shoulders dropped a little, the way they do when someone realizes they’ve just been spared.\nDeclan just shrugged, like it wasn’t a big deal. \nNicole bit back a smile. “Don’t worry about Ryan. He’s a lot more agreeable when there’s dessert on the line.”\nRyan groaned once again from his seat. “You act like I’m some kind of dessert-driven gremlin.”\nKyle laughed and stood, stretching. “Aren’t you?”\nNicole gave Declan a conspiratorial wink. “He once folded all the laundry in the house for a slice of triple chocolate cake. Don’t let the brooding fool you.”\n\n“I was ten.”\nDeclan smirked. “Good to know. I’ll keep chocolate cake in mind if I ever need a favor.”\nThe tight coil of nerves in his chest loosened just a little. The way they all moved around each other felt…safe.\nHe hadn’t realized how much he’d missed that kind of energy. Or maybe how little he’d ever had it in the first place.\nAfter the last dish was rinsed and stacked, the clatter of plates gave way to the softer sounds of evening settling in. Kyle dried his hands on a kitchen towel and nodded toward the hallway. “C’mon, kid. Let’s get you set up.”\n\nNicole offered a gentle smile, already halfway up the stairs with a fresh set of linens tucked under her arm. Declan followed, duffel slung over one shoulder, the adrenaline of the day slowly giving way to exhaustion. \nThe guest room was just off the staircase, second door on the left. When Nicole pushed it open, Declan blinked, surprised.\nThe room was a lot bigger than he expected.\nNot massive, but comfortably spacious. Soft gray walls, a queen bed with a green comforter and a real headboard, not the cinderblock-and-mattress setup he was used to. A big window overlooked the backyard, and a framed print of TD Garden hung over the dresser. A small desk sat under a shelf lined with books and picture frames. It didn’t feel like a guest room. \n\n“Wow,” he muttered. “This is… seriously nice.”\nBehind him, Kyle chuckled. “Look at that. You didn’t even drop an F-bomb this time.”\nDeclan shot him a smirk over his shoulder. “I’m learning.”\nNicole grinned as she set a folded blanket at the foot of the bed. “Fast learner, too. That’s good news.”\nKyle knocked gently on the door connecting to the bathroom. “You and Ryan share this. Jack and Jill setup. Two sinks, one shower. Just don’t spend an hour in there or he’ll lose it.”\n“Noted,” Declan said, still eyeing the space like it might vanish if he blinked.\n\nNicole gave the comforter one last fluff. “Let us know if you need anything. Seriously. Make yourself at home.”\nKyle nodded once, giving him a brief clap on the shoulder. “Big day tomorrow, so get some rest.”\nNicole lingered for a second longer, then stepped forward and wrapped Declan in a quick, warm hug. He froze for half a beat, caught off guard, before awkwardly returning it.\n“Good night, love,” she said softly, giving his arm a gentle squeeze before stepping back.\nDeclan blinked, unsure what to do with the sudden warmth in his chest. No one had called him that in…well, maybe ever.\n\n“Night,” Declan mumbled, voice low.\nKyle paused at the door, gave him a look that was genuine. “We’re glad you’re here, Declan. Really.”\nAnd just like that, they left him to it. The door left slightly ajar, like a quiet sign he wasn’t on his own here.\nDeclan stood for a moment, duffel still in hand, just taking it in. The house was quiet now, except for the faint sound of a TV down the hall and the occasional creak of floorboards.\nHe let out a long breath, dropped his bag by the desk, and sat on the edge of the bed. \nHe kicked off his shoes and lay back, hands behind his head, eyes tracing the ceiling. Through the door of the Jack and Jill bathroom, he could hear faint movement; Ryan brushing his teeth maybe, or just walking around his own room. \nA shared wall, a shared life, starting now.\nMaybe this year wouldn’t suck.", "video": null, "screenshot": null, "prompt_instruction": "You are a professional English-to-Simplified Chinese translator, tasked with providing translations suitable for use in China (zh_CN).

"第二章第一印象\n大巴在圣卡西安学校门前吱的一声停下，然后折叠车门咝的一声打开。\n德克兰.赫尔坐在倒数第二排，手肘搁在膝盖上，拇指紧张地互相搓揉。他的耳机挂在脖子上，音乐早已暂停好一会了，但他根本没注意到。过去一小时他都在凝视窗外飞掠而过的松树林，想着这个学校会不会和其它的一样，\n\n又是个临时的落脚点。\n德克兰缓缓呼了口气，站起来，把行李袋甩到肩上。那只蓝色帆布行李袋又硬又新，侧边绣着金色的圣卡西安校徽。那是学校为他的入学连夜寄给他的，还有校服和球队配发的冰球训练衫。他故意不穿校服，直接穿着训练衫。在拥挤的大巴上坐了七个小时从雪城赶来，谁敢说他迟到还违反着装规定，他就翻脸。\n司机在他下车时微微点了下头。\n\n秋日的空气比他想的要更冷，吸进肺里寒冷而且刺痛。他把防风衣拉链拉高，重新握紧肩上的包。他扫视着宽阔的校区，对石头建筑教学楼与修剪整齐的草坪不感兴趣，但顺着这些放眼看去，远处的冰场映入眼帘。\n就是它了。这是他来这上学的原因。\n冰球是唯一有意义的东西，其它无关紧要。\n冰面才是他的自由之地。在那他可以随意移动，自由思考，而且他很强。他生活中没有什么像冰球那般纯粹的事物。\n\n他把肩上的包拉高了些，肌肉的记忆促使他走向冰场。几乎不用大脑决定，双足自然而然就迈向那里。然而一个声音把他从思绪中拉了出来。\n“打扰下，亲爱的！你是新生吗？”\n一个穿着圣卡西安学校西装外套的年长女士站在学校大门那朝他挥手，手里拿着文件夹，严肃的气场让他不得不停下来。\n“哦，对，”被阳光照得眯着眼睛，他说。我叫德克兰。德克兰.赫尔。”\n“哦，你好，德克兰。”她笑着赶上来，虽有些喘气，但很热情。“我是希瑟.伯克，招生主任。”仿佛这套动作已经被重复过了上百次，她伸出手，带着训练有素的亲切感，\n\n“你好。”德克兰边说边和她握手。他的握手有力但迅速，礼貌得体，但目光不时飘向冰场。\n她注意到他眼神老是飘向向冰场，于是会心一笑地。\n“你已经准备好了去那，对吧？”她语气里带着一丝鼓励，“那我们就不拖延了。我知道教练们都等着见你。走吧？”\n她转身就朝冰场走去，丝毫不担心他会跟不上来。\n德克兰啥也没说，只是重新调整了下行李袋，跟了上来，眼睛盯着前方。\n\n“那么，”她哼一声打破沉默，“你没上前两天的课。我这儿有你所有的课堂笔记和作业。”\n她边走边递给他一个文件夹；蓝金配色，上面烫着发光的皇冠与剑的校徽。德克兰差点翻了个白眼。连作业都要印上个校徽。\n“通常我们对迟交作业是零容忍的。”她继续说。“但考虑到你的实际情况，你可以延后到这周五再交。如果你需要个辅导老师帮你跟上班，我们可以安排。”\n德克兰的脑子已经开始嗡嗡作响，他已被各种期望和截止日期压得透不过气来。希瑟一定是看出来了。她在他背上轻拍了一下，好像这样可以让他放松点似的。\n\n“别担心，所有你需要知道的都在学生手册里。”她语气轻松随便，很显然早已习惯了新生脸上这种不知所措的表情。\n省省吧。他们电邮过来的那一大堆学生手册资料。好像他会专门坐下来逐字阅读似的。\n在德克兰的大脑被各种负担压到当机前，希瑟推开了冰场的大门。一股冷气猛然袭面而来，让他头皮发麻，瞬间将他脑中的混乱思绪驱散。\n总算到了。\n“从这里去就是贝努瓦教练的办公室。”希瑟边说边把他领进走廊。\n她敲敲门，门立刻被拉开了。门里出来的男人和学校官网照片里的一模一样，带着那种一眼就可以让人认出的灿烂笑容。他像见到老朋友一样看着德克兰。\n\n“德克兰！”他满怀喜悦地大声打招呼，笑容更加灿烂了。“欢迎来到圣卡西安！路上顺利吗？”\n“漫长。”德克兰耸耸肩回答，声音里还带着长途旅行的疲惫。“不过我很高兴终于到了。”\n卢克信心十足的上前握手，劲道十足又充满热情。“我们很高兴你能加入。”他转头对希瑟笑着说。“伯克老师，感谢你亲自跑一趟格里芬冰场。”\n她轻快地笑着摆摆手。“随时效劳。如果有需要，你知道我在哪儿。”她最后点点头，便转身离开，高跟鞋带着节奏地敲击着冰场地板。\n\n“进来吧，德克兰。”卢克一边把门推开一边让路让他进来。\n德克兰跨过门槛走几步后停了下来。他的目光落在房间里另一个早在等候的男人身上，这人他认识。他身子一紧。\n“哇，等下。你是凯尔.巴恩斯。”德克兰脱口而出，嘴角那天第一次露出了笑。长途旅程的疲劳、紧张和那堆该死的作业都暂时不见了。\n凯尔的笑容轻松自信。他上前伸出手。\n“很高兴认识你，德克兰。我听过关于你的很多事。”\n\n德克兰和他握了手，脸上几乎藏不住敬畏之意。他吐了口气，难以置信的震惊加上紧张让他大脑来不及思考，嘴就先动了。\n“我去年的幻想队选了你。说真的，你害我输掉了总冠军。”\n话一出口，他立马闭嘴，笑容瞬间退去，被惊慌取代。该死，他心想。见面五分钟就同一位国家冰球联盟的大明星这样打趣。他几乎想找个地缝钻进去。\n身后传来一阵窃笑。德克兰侧头一瞟，看见卢克教练正一手半捂着嘴，明显在强忍笑意。\n\n凯尔也点点头，嘴角抽搐让自己忍住不笑。“是吗？真抱歉让你失望了。我猜退役是件好事，省得再让几支幻想队伤心。\n德克兰张了张嘴，但又立马闭上，后颈开始发热。“我的意思是……但是，你对抗国王队那场全国总冠军赛太猛啦。第七场加时赛那球?神级的。”他挠挠后颈。“那么……嗯，你怎么会在圣卡西安？你在这儿当教练吗？我没在官网上看到你的名字。”\n\n卢克坐回椅子上，在他往后靠时，椅子的皮革轻轻作响。他指指对面的椅子。“其实，我们正想和你谈这事。”\n德克兰坐下来，行李包还挂在肩上，眼中闪烁着好奇。他不知道自己在期待什么，但卢克的语气让他下意识坐得更直了些。\n卢克俯身，前臂撑在桌面上，语气变了，缓慢而认真。他看了一眼凯尔，目光又回到德克兰身上。\n“来圣卡西安这种新学校并非小事。你将面对一个全新环境，远离家乡，怀着期待，不论是在冰场，课堂，还是社交场合。这对任何人来说都不易，即使像你这样有才华的小孩。”\n\n他顿了顿，让对方消化后再继续。\n“当得知你要加入我们时，我们首先讨论的是如何帮你更顺利地过渡。你在哪落脚。和谁一起。不是简单的一个晚上睡觉的地方，而是一个让你觉得真正踏实的地方。”\n卢克朝凯尔点点头。“凯尔一家这个夏天刚搬来。他儿子瑞恩就是你的新队友之一。他太太妮可是那种会把一个地方的气氛变得很温馨的人，让你一进门就有家的感觉。而凯尔？嗯，你知道他是谁。”\n\n他又顿了顿，不是为了制造悬念，而是因为下面这些话非常重要。\n“他不是教练组成员，至少不是正式的。但他是我们构建的新系统的一员。一个全新的支持体系；球员发展、人生引导、领导力培养，无论是场内还是场外。而我们希望你也成为其中一份子。”\n卢克笑容轻松，稍微歪歪嘴。“那么，这是我们给你的提议：凯尔一家愿意接纳你。如果你愿意，我们觉得这会很合适。但我们不强求。我们想先把这个消息告诉你。\n德克兰愣住了，措手不及。他完全没有料到。完全没有。\n\n所有他待过的寄宿学校都千篇一律；宿舍、室友、共用浴室，还有嘈杂的环境。而这次？住在校外？和前国家冰球联盟的大球星及家人住在一起？这……很新奇。\n德克兰对卢克和凯尔来回看了看，试图去细品他讲的每一个字，想搞清楚自己是否真的可以做出选择，还是让他非得这么做的客气话。\n“我以为我要住在学校，”他终于开口，声音很小，但不带敌意，只是坦诚。\n卢克点点头，显然他早就料到了这个反应。“这我完全明白。是的，大多数学生都住校。但考虑到你的背景，还有我们对你竞技水平的期待，我们想试试不同的方法。给你打个更好的基础。”\n\n德克兰在座位上挪了下身体，他还在消化这一切。要和凯尔.巴恩斯住在一起。每天和这位曾在全国大赛中威震四方的球星同桌吃饭。这信息量太大。\n凯尔轻轻一笑，看出了他眼中的犹豫。“信息量有点大，对吧？”\n德克兰没回答，但脸上的表情已经说出了一切。他仔细看着凯尔，感受着巨大的压力。\n凯尔往后靠着椅背上，换了个更舒适的姿态，但眼神依旧敏锐且带着穿透力。“我以前也处在你现在的位置过。陌生的城市。陌生的球队。巨大的压力。如果不小心，这些就会让你心力交瘁。”\n\n德克兰脑中掠过他从下车那一刻起就感到的种种焦虑。凯尔怎么就知道他的感受呢？他好像一眼就看透了他所有的心结。那沉重而且熟悉的对不确定性的不安感，再次占据大脑，可不知为什么，无需交流，就被凯尔都捕捉到了。\n“我知道这不容易，孩子。”凯尔像父亲一样轻轻叹口气。他的语气温和但不失坚定。“是这样的。如果你和我们住，你不只是暂时借住到某个寄宿家庭。我是在给你一个喘口气的空间。当你感到一切都悬在半空时，你仍可以有个双足接地的地方。\n\n德克兰喉咙一紧。那一刻仿佛房内的时间都静止了。\n“冰球是一场艰苦的旅程。”凯尔继续说，“而且，没错，我会逼你拼尽全力。但我也会一路上在背后支持你。这不仅仅是数据或是在场上花了多少时间，而是你该如何成为一个可以应对长期挑战的球员，一个有担当的人。而我经历过各种跌打。很明白这需要什么。”\n他随意地交叉着手臂，锋芒的语气开始软化，变得和蔼可亲。“我明白这是个重大的决定。所以我的建议是，你今晚先住到我们家。不要有压力，看看环境，见见妮可和瑞恩，感受一下。如果你明天仍觉得合适，我们再谈。”\n\n德克兰都没意识到自己在点头，直到动作已做了一半。\n凯尔的语气里有种东西；平静而直接，仿佛他真明白自己的感受。他的话如一把利刃刺开了自己脑中的杂音。他不知道发生了什么，起码不是真的明白。即使那样，这个男人已经不知不觉地在他心里产生了某种影响。不是强迫。而是……平稳。稳固。来自一个言出必行、直面困难的人。\n还从来没有哪个大人给过他这种感觉。老师没有教练没有甚至连他的亲生父亲也没有。\n\n所以，即使他对这一切还没完全缓过神来，但他的头却还是一直在点。\n“好吧。”他终于说。“我愿意试一下。”\n卢克和凯尔迅速交换了一个笑脸，那是一种平静而满足的神情。\n“很好！”卢克说，兴奋情绪溢于言表。他身体前倾，眼里放光。“在去训练前，你还有什么问题或想法吗？”\n德克兰顿了下，有个问题在空中悬了一秒。他来回看看卢克和凯尔，摇摇头。“我现在没问题。”\n“好的，那就先去安顿好自己。”卢克边说边站起身来，指指走廊。“更衣室在走廊尽头的右边。那有个隔间已经贴上了你的名字，装备都在那，已经准备好了。”\n\n德克兰起身，握紧了手中的旅行袋。\n卢克对他点了点头。“我们二十分钟后开始训练。雷诺兹教练会在冰场上等你。”\n凯尔也起了身，依然带着那股平静的气场。“我们等会见。妮可今晚做帕玛森鸡排，希望那时你饿了。”\n德克兰不经意微笑了下。“好。听起来不错。”\n他边说着，边转身走向走廊，努力不去想脑中那些不断飞速闪过的念头。\n训练在一次次干脆的传球、急转弯和那种只有在冰鞋划过新鲜冰面时他才能获得的快感中飞逝而过。德克兰完全不需要适应，他的本能已经在第一轮训练中被唤醒。没过多久，周围的目光开始纷纷向他聚焦，教练们也悄悄互相点头表示认可。\n\n这种感觉真好。轻松。就像轻松套上一件最合身的衣服那样简单。\n训练结束后，更衣室里充满了训练后的兴奋；撕胶带的声音，装备扔到长凳上发出的闷响，还有不断从隔间里传出的打闹声。\n“新生表现得不错嘛。”一个后卫边脱球衣边笑着喊。\n德克兰一边脱下护垫一边得意地笑。“我想先露一小手，明天再震憾你们。”\n几人发出大大的“噢噢噢”一声，其中一个还把卷起来的臭袜扔了过来。\n德克兰侧身躲开袜子，却无意看到瑞恩正在更衣室的另一边看着他。那眼神没有敌意，只是……静静的。观察。仿佛还在研究他是个怎样的人。\n\n但德克兰还没来得及认真想，瑞恩便起身，把连帽衫套过自己的湿头发给穿上，然后一言不发出去了。\n其他人还在嬉闹，但那个瞬间却让他难忘。\n德克兰脱下了所有的护具，把旅行袋拎上肩。当他走进走廊时，他看到了他们；凯尔和瑞恩正站在冰场门外等待。凯尔的手搭在儿子的肩上，声音平和，那是种父亲才会有的语气。\n瑞恩好像在对父亲说的什么点着头，目光对着地面。德克兰没有听清他们在说什么，但他一眼就看出他们的关系很亲密。非常亲密。\n\n这种冲击让他措手不及。\n凯尔抬眼一看，看到了德克兰，他脸上早已露出笑容，随意挥了挥手。“他到啦。撑过了卢克教练的首次训练？”\n德克兰点点头，走近他们。“差点没撑住。”他这样回答，但嘴角却带着一抹掩不住的得意。\n瑞恩瞥了他一眼，但没说什么。只是稍微点下头，然后径直走向了停车场。\n“走吧。”凯尔边说边轻轻拍了拍德克兰的背。“咱们回家吧。”\n家。这个词在他听起来有点奇怪。但当他跟着他们走向凯尔的车时，压在他胸口的某些东西似乎轻了点。\n\n车内很安静，是那种德克兰很渴望得到，但之前并没有意识到的安静。没人问他问题，也没人用闲聊打破沉默。瑞恩戴着耳机，独自望着窗外发呆。凯尔一手握着方向盘，一手随意搭在中央面板上，时不时地随着车里音响，轻声哼唱着柔和的经典摇滚。\n德克兰把头靠在车窗上，看着外面世界快速地掠过。不宽的道路蜿蜒穿过茂盛的树林，初秋让树林被焦橙、深红和金黄色点缀着。这和城市截然不同。一种刻意的宁静感，安静祥和。\n\n他之前坐大巴时完全没注意到这些，只记得背痛和紧张的神经。但现在……现在似乎没那么糟。\n车驶离主路，拐进一条安静的林荫小道，轮胎在旧沥青路面上发出轻微的嗡嗡声。德克兰望着窗外，看见那些嵌在山坡上的古雅别墅，大多带着宽敞的门廊和整洁的院子。这里，时间仿佛不动了，就像整个世界都屏住了呼吸。\n他们驶进一条朴素的车道，尽头是栋两层别墅，深蓝色的外墙配着白色饰边。窗户里透出柔和的黄色灯光，在暮色笼罩整个社区时，传递出一股温暖友好的气息。\n\n凯尔把车停好，发动机的低鸣打破了夜晚的寂静。他转过头微笑看着德克兰。“这就是我们的家。回家真好，”他的语气轻快，但带种默默的肯定，仿佛是在许下一个无言的承诺。\n德克兰没说话，只是打开车门走了下去。空气中闻起来有种淡淡的松木和烟囱的味道。这么多周来，他从未感受到如此的平静。\n瑞恩已经在门前开锁了，身影映照在门廊的灯光下。\n凯尔轻轻拍了拍德克兰的肩膀，然后上了台阶。“走吧，妮可做好了晚餐在等着我们呢。今天一整天她都在问你的事。”\n\n门吱呀一声打开，寒冷的夜晚里一股暖风扑面而来，夹杂着蒜香和番茄酱的味道。德克兰跟在凯尔身后进了屋，木地板在球鞋下感觉非常光滑，柔和的漫射光让整个室内显得温馨宜人。\n“嗨！”厨房里传来个声音。片刻后，一位女人走了出来，一边用厨房毛巾擦着手。她身材高挑，体型健美，那利落又温柔的气质一下就填满了整个房间。“你一定是德克兰了。”\n德克兰犹豫了一下，有点紧张。他点着头，在考虑是该挥手还是握手，大脑还在寻找合适的对应方式。“呃，对。你好。”\n\n还没来得及说点其它什么，妮可已经走了上来，热情地张开双臂。然后毫不犹豫一把把他拉进怀里。\n“很高兴见到你！”她说着，同时像母亲一样轻轻拍着他的背，然后才松开他。“我是妮可。希望你饿了，我做了帕玛森鸡排。全家最爱。”\n“嗯……确实饿了。”\n这时候，瑞恩已经上了楼，脚步声在众人上方消失，剩下三个人站在开放式的厨房和客厅里。德克兰四处张望。墙上挂着家庭的照片，餐桌上已经摆了半桌子的菜，厨房里飘来的香味让他肚子咕咕叫。这一切让他感到很踏实，就如这里住着的一群真心热爱生活的人。\n\n妮可指着台前的一张凳子。”“坐，放松点。几分钟后就开饭了。你对任何食物过敏吗？\n“不。”\n凯尔已经从柜子里拿出盘子。“他今天在训练中表现得很不错。”他侧过头随口说道，透露着理所当然的口气。\n妮可扬起眉看着德克兰。“了不起。第一天就开始显摆啦？”\n他耸耸肩，心里闪过一丝小骄傲。“只是不想拖大家后腿。”\n这给了他……一种他从未体验过的舒适感。也许，他现在不用再一直绷紧神经了。\n等到他们坐下吃晚饭的时候，那份舒适感依然还在。\n\n德克兰只是小犹豫了一下，就坐到了瑞恩旁边的椅子上。而瑞恩已经像在和别人比赛一样开始狼吞虎咽了。他看了眼自己的那份，尝了一口，立刻对瑞恩的吃态感同身受。帕玛森鸡排好吃到不行。\n德克兰又咬了一口，酥脆的油煎面包屑外皮和浓郁的马瑞那拉酱的味道达到了完美的平衡。味道好得超乎想象。因此他情不自禁低声嘀咕了一句：“太他妈好吃啦。”\n话音刚落，整个房间顿时安静下来。瑞恩的叉子停在了半空，猛地看向德克兰，眼中满是震惊和难以置信，仿佛德克兰刚在饭桌上引爆了颗炸弹。\n\n德克兰却完全没察觉到变化，仍然咀嚼着，全然沉浸在美味中，直到他无意瞟了一眼四周。\n然后他就注意到了。那突然而至的紧张气氛。那种死静。\n凯尔的声音打破沉默，平稳中带着不容置疑的权威。“德克兰。”他用缓慢带着节奏的语气说。“我们不讲那种话，尤其是在餐桌上。”\n德克兰愣住了，措手不及。“哦。嗯，我们……但我们是打冰球的，”他耸耸肩，试图轻描淡写地敷衍过去，这算是正常的吧。”\n凯尔没有笑。他的脸仍然平静，但眼神中闪过一丝威严，提醒他这不是随便说说的。“是的，冰场上或许可以。但你还太小，不该讲那样的话。”\n\n德克兰皱起眉头，有点结巴。“你-什么？”\n凯尔目光坚定，不容动摇。“在这个家里，我们要文明说话。尊重彼此。”\n德克兰的困惑溢于言表，他靠向瑞恩，压低了声音。“你也不这么说吗？”他问道，确实好奇，不知道该如何看待这一切。\n还没等瑞恩回答，妮可说话了，她的声音依然轻松但非常坚定。“除非他想嚼肥皂。”\n瑞恩滑稽地瞪大了眼睛，声音里带着恐慌。“妈！”\n妮可眼都不眨。“只是先告诉你。”她露出了一丝意味深长的笑。\n\n德克兰胸口一紧。嚼肥皂？。她是认真的吗？他偷偷督了一眼凯尔，对方眼中没有丝毫开玩笑的意思，只有威而不怒且坚决的态度。\n凯尔清了清嗓子，靠着椅背，表情稍微缓和了一些，表示他不生气，但也不会让步。\n“是的，我们知道。冰球队文化、换衣间的玩笑，但这不一样。当我们有正当理由时，可以激动，这我们不介意。但在我们家，有些底线是不能越过的。”他意味深长地看了德克兰一眼，确保话语的分量到位。“你来这里不仅是打冰球，更是为了成长。这意味着，不论是在场内还是场外，都要学会自律。”\n\n德克兰无法否认这些话带给他的冲击。他的胃稍微一紧，不是因为愤怒，而是别的东西。那绝不是什么安慰之词，但是，这也许就是他需要的：明白对与错的差别。\n瑞恩又看了他一眼，表情难以揣摩，仿佛在重新评估德克兰。而另一边，妮可已重回厨房在给另一轮食物装盘，仿佛刚才的一幕根本没有发生过。但德克兰已经明白，这家人不是开玩笑的。\n他轻轻吐了口气，不太确定该说什么。“嗯，是的。对不起。”\n他靠在椅背上，看着自己的盘子，试图整理思绪。刚才突然改变的气氛让他有点不知所措。\n\n凯尔点点头，再次缓和语气，声音节奏依然那么稳健。“没事。”他嘴角露出了安抚的笑容。“好了，现在，开吃吧。”\n德克兰接到了凯尔的眼神，他点了点头，不好意思地笑了。\n瑞恩仍然瞅着他，像在研究某种稀有物种，然后轻呼一口气，又去埋头吃饭了。凯尔向瑞恩投去了一个他再熟悉不过的眼神，伴随着那种半命令半建议的要求。\n“嘿，你吃完饭后帮德克兰一起做作业怎么样？”\n瑞恩立刻呻吟，叉子撞在盘子上。“我又不是家教。”\n\n凯尔毫不退让。他只是扬起了眉毛，是那种严峻但也留出余地的扬眉表情。好像是在说：你确定要这么说吗，儿子？\n瑞恩像泄了气的气球一样长叹一声，仿佛刚被要求用牙刷刷整个冰场。“爸，拜托，我自己也有作业。而且我今天真得累爆了。”他更加懒洋洋地坐着，好像马上就要和自己的椅子融为一体。\n在气氛还没有进一步僵住前，德克兰出声救场。“没关系。伯克老师说我可以找个辅导老师补课。真没事。”\n凯尔没有收回对瑞恩的扬眉表情，但也朝德克兰点了点头。“行。明天我们去找学校谈谈，给你安排一个。”\n\n瑞恩看了德克兰一眼，那种既意外又隐藏感激的眼神。他没说谢谢，但肩膀放松了一点，像刚意识到自己被解救了一样。\n德克兰只是耸了耸肩，好像在说没什么大不了。\n妮可忍着笑。“别担心瑞恩。当甜点端上来后，他情绪会好起来的。”\n瑞恩又呻吟了一声。“你说得我好像是什么嗜甜精怪似的。”\n凯尔笑着站起来，再伸了个懒腰。“你不是吗？”\n妮可朝德克兰诡秘地眨了一下眼。“他曾为了块三层巧克力蛋糕把全家的衣服都叠完了。别被他那发牢骚的样子给唬了。”\n\n“我那时才十岁。”\n德克兰得意地笑了。“太好了。以后要是需要你帮忙，我会记得带上块巧克力蛋糕的。”\n他胸口那紧绷的神经稍微又放松了一点。他们之间的互动方式让人感到……安全。\n他还没意识到他是多么怀念这种感觉啊。或者，也许他从一开始就从未体会过这种感觉。\n当最后一只盘子被洗干净摆好在沥水架上时，那哗啦啦的碰撞声渐渐消失，取而代之的是夜晚悄然降临的温馨与柔和。凯尔用厨房毛巾擦了擦手，朝走廊点点头。“来，孩子，我们去帮你安顿下来。”\n\n妮可温柔地朝德克兰笑了笑，已经走到楼梯上，胳膊下夹着一套干净的床单。德克兰肩膀上挂着他的行李袋紧随其后，白天的肾上腺素终于开始退去，疲惫正慢慢袭来。\n客房就是楼梯边上左手第二间。妮可推开门，德克兰眨了下眼，愣了一下。\n房间比他预想的要大得多。\n房间不是巨大型的，是那种令人感到舒适的大小。柔和的浅灰墙壁、一张铺着绿色被子的大双人床，接着一个真正的床头板，不是他习惯的那种煤渣砖加床垫的简易拼凑。它有一扇俯瞰后院的大窗户，抽屉柜上方的墙上还挂着一幅多伦多道明银行花园的镶框画。摆满书籍和相框的书架下面是一张小书桌。这根本不像是客房。\n\n“哇。”他低低咕哝了一声。“这……真好呀。”\n凯尔在他身后轻笑。“你看。这次你都没有飙脏话。”\n德克兰回头冲他一笑。“我还在学习。”\n妮可笑着把折好的毛毯压在在床尾。“而且学得飞快。这真不错。”\n凯尔轻轻敲了敲房间连接浴室的门。“你和瑞恩共用这个。杰克和吉尔式的设计，有两个洗手池，一个淋浴。就是别在里面淋几个钟头，不然他会发狂的。”\n“记住了。”德克兰回道，仍打量着四周，生怕一眨眼眼前的一切都会消失似的。\n\n妮可把被子最后再拍了一下。“需要什么就说。我说真的。把这儿当自己的家。”\n凯尔也点了一下头，伸手轻轻拍了他肩膀一下。“明天会很忙，早点休息。”\n妮可多逗留了一下，她走上前去给了德克兰一个快速温暖的拥抱。他愣了一下，有点措手不及，然后还是尴尬地回抱了一下。\n“晚安，宝贝。”她轻轻地说，同时轻轻地捏了下他的胳膊，然后退了回去。\n德克兰眨眨眼，不知道该如何应对心底突然升起的那股暖流。自从……不，也许从来都没有谁像这样称呼过他。\n\n“晚安，”德克兰低声咕哝道。\n凯尔在门口停住，然后眼神真诚地看着他。“我们很高兴你来了，德克兰。是真话。”\n就这样，他们离开了，把房间交给了他。门半掩着，仿佛在轻轻提醒他，这里你不孤独。\n德克兰站了会，行李袋还抓在手中，静静地感受着这一切。整栋房子现在变得很安静，只是走廊尽头传来些微弱的电视声和地板偶尔发出的吱呀声。\n他长长吐了口气，把包扔到书桌旁，坐到床边。\n他踢掉鞋子，向后躺倒在床上，双手枕着头，看着天花板。从连接杰克和吉尔式浴室的门后，他能听见微弱的动静：或许是瑞恩在刷牙，或许是瑞恩在自己房里走动。\n共用的墙，共同的生活，现在开始啦。\n或许，今年不会太糟。"}}}

Broadcom may have another custom chip partner\n\nEvery weekday, the CNBC Investing Club with Jim Cramer releases the Homestretch - an actionable afternoon update, just in time for the last hour of trading on Wall Street. Market moves: Stocks were higher to start the new week, with the Dow, the S&P 500, and the Nasdaq shrugging off the trade and tariff headlines that caused weakness on Wall Street last week. Energy was the top-performing sector Monday, thanks to gains in oil and natural gas prices. Our lone oil and nat gas name, Coterra Energy, was jumping roughly 3.8%. Tech, however, was the main driver of the overall market gains due to the strength in the Magnificent Seven stocks. The Club owns six of them: Apple, Alphabet, Amazon, Meta Platforms, Microsoft, and Nvidia. The seventh Mag 7 stock is Tesla. The only two sectors sitting out Monday's rally were health care and financials. Both sectors are among the top gainers so far this year but have come under pressure in February. All three of our financial positions - Wells Fargo, Goldman Sachs, and BlackRock - are presenting at conferences on Tuesday. So, we'll hear the latest from each of them. \n\nBroadcom: One of Broadcom 's new custom AI chip partnerships is coming into focus. Reuters reported Monday that ChatGPT creator OpenAI is finalizing the design for its first in-house chip. The story suggests the chip is in the later stages and could begin to be mass-produced later this year. Taiwan Semiconductor is the fab that will manufacture this new custom chip, but the story says the chip was designed by OpenAI's in-house team in collaboration with Broadcom. The Hock Tan-led Broadcom currently has three custom AI chip customers, and those clients are widely believed to be Alphabet and Meta - and most recently, ByteDance, the Chinese owner of TikTok. When Broadcom last reported earnings in December, one of the reasons why the stock soared almost 25% was Tan's reveal that the company was in advanced AI chip development with two additional hyperscalers. Based on previous media reports, OpenAI and Apple are believed to be those two customers. Microsoft is a financial backer and partner of OpenAI. On Broadcom's December earnings call, Tan estimated the company's service addressable market (SAM) for its AI business, which includes sales of both custom and networking chips, was $60 billion to $90 billion. That bullish target did not include custom silicon sales from these two new customers. If all the reporting is true, having a fourth AI chip customer in production is great news for Broadcom's ability to capture this large SAM. Broadcom shares jumped 4.5% on Monday. But they were still below their Jan. 24 close before Chinese startup DeepSeek went viral with claims of a cheaper AI model that slammed chip stocks. \n\nUp next: It's a quieter week of earnings. Some companies reporting after the closing bell Monday are Vertex Pharmaceutical, Lattice Semiconductor, and Astera Labs. Before the opening bell on Tuesday, Coca-Cola, Marriott, Humana, and Club name DuPont report quarterly resuts. (See here for a full list of the stocks in Jim Cramer's Charitable Trust.)

His stunning knock of 150 off 148 balls, laced with 11 fours and five sixes, surpassed the previous record held by the legendary West Indies' batter Desmond Haynes, who scored 148 in his maiden ODI innings against Australia back in 1978. Before Breetzke's innings, the highest score on ODI debut for South Africa was 124 by Colin Ingram against Zimbabwe in 2010. Now, Breetzke stands alone at the top, delivering a performance that showcased patience, aggression, and remarkable shot selection as South Africa posted a mammoth 304/6.\n\nFresh off a month-long stint in the SA20 2025 season, Breetzke seamlessly transitioned into the ODI format, forming a crucial second-wicket stand of 93 runs with Jason Smith (41). He reached his half-century off 68 balls and continued to build on his solid start, eventually reaching his maiden century in 128 deliveries with the help of six boundaries and two sixes. In doing so, he became only the fourth South African to score an ODI century on debut, joining an elite club featuring Ingram, his current captain Temba Bavuma, and Reeza Hendricks.\n\nPost-century, Breetzke punished O'Rourke with two boundaries and a six in a single over, thus accelerating South Africa's late-innings scoring and building momentum for the Proteas. While his partnership with Smith provided early stability, he went on to forge another century stand for the fourth wicket with Wiaan Mulder (64), pushing South Africa past the 300-run mark.

Cheers to that!\n\nI'm not sure I can remember exactly when I sensed it. Maybe it was when some of the more gimmicky London pubs introduced \"stamp cards\" to ration out Guinness after news of a shortage; maybe it was when I was served the 500th London Guinness rating video by my Instagram algorithm. Regardless of the precise moment the notion arrived, however, I have felt for a while that we are heading for a change when it comes to the pint du jour. For a few years now, Guinness has been the fashionable choice for millennial and gen Z drinkers, swept up in the aesthetic renaissance of the Good Old-Fashioned Bloody Pub. But I think the tide is turning. This will probably be the year that the Irish stout stops being cool.\n\nI'm pretty sure that what will finally usher the Guinness hype train back into the station will be the same thing that came for Aperol spritzes and truffle: overexposure. The Aperol, once a genuinely trendy, vaguely Sex and the City-ish aperitivo-style drink is now a cultural behemoth in its own right - delicious, certainly, but definitely no longer \"cool.\" And truffle, well ... would you like a side of truffle fries for that truffle mac and cheese garnished with truffle oil?\n\nOverexposure, of course, is the death knell for cool in most cases (or at least self-conscious, trend-following \"coolness,\" as I mean it here). This is particularly true amid the one-upmanship of contemporary food and drink culture which, as defined by social media, is always about being the first to find the undiscovered or most novel thing - the \"hidden gem,\" the bakery and \"pasta space\" in London's zone 6 or what have you (\"Come with me to the pub in Richmond that regularly floods\"). And while Guinness's current round of popularity began because it was once viewed among younger pubgoers as a left-field choice - an \"if you know, you know\" order - it now couldn't be less of a secret.\n\nUndeniably, Guinness is everywhere. For the 2024-25 season, it shafted Budweiser to become the official beer of the Premier League, and will hold this honour for the next four years. It is the official beer of rugby's Six Nations tournament (meaning that for the next month, it is also the official beer of people called Henry). And a few months ago, news broke that the brand will be opening a Guinness Storehouse attraction, described as a \"microbrewery and culture hub,\" in Covent Garden - despite the fact that London has nothing to do with Guinness or its 250-year-old heritage. Add to this the countless Hinge prompts about \"splitting the G,\" and the impenetrable gaggle of gilets that pretty much always surrounds Soho's Guinness Disneyland, otherwise known as the wildly successful Devonshire pub, and you have to admit that the brand's cool stock is sinking.\n\nI don't speak as a Guinness naysayer. On the contrary, I grew up with a Dublin man and former pub landlord for a grandfather, so reverence for the stout is all but in my blood. As such, Guinness is pretty much the only pint I regularly drink, and I'll even admit that I'm One Of Those People who has long-winded opinions about their favourite Guinness in London, and who really does believe that it differs in quality depending on where you order it (it's all in the gas, the installation and the line-cleaning).\n\nWhile Guinness may be at significant risk of losing its edge among, say, people who queue outside bakeries, this hardly matters to its bottom line. It has surpassed cult status, and has in essence become too big to fail. Debra Crew, chief executive of Diageo, the drinks conglomerate that owns the brand, told press this week that demand for the stout in October and November 2024 had surpassed even the amount called for during St Patrick's Day celebrations, noting that the clamour was \"unprecedented.\" Crew also stated that Diageo is spending €200m (£170m) on a new Guinness factory in Kildare to keep supplies up to the level now required.\n\nMusic to my ears, really - I'm just pleased that while years ago you could walk into a pub and reasonably expect that Guinness wouldn't be served there, these days I can pretty much get my preferred pint anywhere. And, among all of the arguments to explain the surge in approval for the drink, it is important to acknowledge the obvious one: its smooth texture and subtly rich taste do just combine to offer something genuinely delicious, even when you get a mediocre one.\n\nUltimately, I'm more than happy to let the hype move on to a less obvious drink (over the past couple of weeks, I've been in two south-east London pubs that have recently installed the rival stout Murphy's, owing to local demand - go figure). Because as annoying as social media Guinness chat might be, and despite the extent to which the Schooner Scorer's camera angles haunt my nightmares (I mean it, don't Google it), it's like a wise man called Robbie Williams once sang: \"You can't argue with popularity. Well you could, but you'd be wrong.\"", "video": null, "screenshot": null, "prompt_instruction": "You are a professional English-to-Simplified Chinese translator, tasked with providing translations suitable for use in China (zh_CN).

Paul Wills's clever arrangement of television screens and speakers, all linked up by glowing capillary-like tubes, encapsulates Malorie Blackman's 1997 novel about a boy whose pig-heart transplant leads to a media frenzy. Andrew Exeter's lighting switches from blood red to cool blue for scenes when 13-year-old Cameron repeatedly puts himself - and, eventually, his new heart - to the test when diving at his local pool.\n\nBlackman's novel is itself a deep dive: this \"what would you do?\" book for young readers considers ethics, animal rights, othering and empathy. Keeping the pre-social media setting, Winsome Pinnock's new adaptation draws upon the heightened poetic style of Blackman's opening chapter. Pinnock retains the narrator's spirited interest in wordplay, boosts the wisdom of Cameron's Nan and makes water more of a unifying theme throughout the story. Her version also takes a thrilling new turn towards the end.\n\nTristan Fynn-Aiduenu's boisterous production has some vivid performances, too, including by Immanuel Yeboah in the main role. But by overplaying the comedy it drowns out some of the story's more reflective episodes. In the novel, Cameron often cracks jokes, even when face to face with the animal named Trudy whose heart he will receive, yet that encounter is hugely moving as the boy is overwhelmed with relief, fear, guilt and hope. On stage, Trudy is played as a disco-queen pig with pink puffer jacket and oversized glasses; discovering Cameron's plans for her heart, she squeals in jokey horror. Elsewhere, animal rights are thinly discussed.\n\nThe production is more successful at conveying how Cameron is viewed by his classmates both before the operation (when they see his illness as fragility) and after (when he is still considered different to them). The children are played by an adult cast, most doubling up as the grownup characters. The pioneering Dr Bryce (Tré Medley) is amusingly portrayed as a spy-like smooth operator, all dressed in white both in and out of his laboratory, when that set design again works efficiently. Christina Ngoyi as his best friend Marilyn (Marlon in the book) has the right note of compromised loyalty; Christine During's popular Julie has a buoyant ease but her later fear of Cameron again tips into comedy.\n\nCameron's asides to the audience include a raucous interrogation about who sold his story to the press that is strained and distracts from his inner tumult. The screens on stage could be used more effectively during Cameron's TV interview and for the camcorder footage he records for his brother.\n\nThe show is aimed at nine to 13-year-olds (probably geared more towards the younger side of that range) and dynamically captures the turbulent world of school thanks in part to DK Fashola's movement direction, especially appealing in an early slo-mo sequence. This staging has plenty of style and flows swiftly, helped by Xana's sound design and compositions - but it never has quite the same direct appeal to head and heart as Blackman's book.", "video": null, "screenshot": null, "prompt_instruction": "You are a professional English-to-Simplified Chinese translator, tasked with providing translations suitable for use in China (zh_CN).

This is the sudden, startling emergence into American political life of a type deeply recognisable to Brits: that is, jaunty young men with juvenile nicknames and a firm belief they should be running the world.\n\nThis being America, the class signifiers are slightly different from those in Britain. But in most regards, the cohort of young men hired by Elon Musk for his cost-cutting taskforce, the department of government efficiency (Doge), will be familiar to anyone who lived through the era of Boris Johnson's weapons-grade flippancy or reports of David Cameron's youthful hijinks. (Donald Trump is very flippant, of course, but his style skews locker room rather than debate chamber - or, in this case, maths olympiad.) And while politics has always run on young, volunteer energy, less common in the US, perhaps, is the imperial swagger, the sheer frivolous entitlement accompanying a crowd that has seemingly been given the keys to the kingdom.\n\nLet's look at the lineup. The youngest of Musk's Doge hires, Edward Coristine - online username, Big Balls - is a 19-year-old former intern at Neuralink, Musk's neurotechnology company, who until recently appeared to be a first-year student at Northeastern University in Boston. Luke Farritor is a 23-year-old former SpaceX intern. Marko Elez, 25, used to work for X and SpaceX, and was revealed by the Wall Street Journal to have authored several since-removed tweets asserting, among other things, \"You could not pay me to marry outside of my ethnicity.\" (Elez briefly resigned before Musk announced he'd reinstate him.)\n\nAnd Gavin Kliger, a 25-year-old who boosted a post on X by the white supremacist Nick Fuentes, and whose newly launched Substack this week highlighted the perils of skipping freshman English 101 with a post entitled \"Why DOGE: Why I gave up a seven-figure salary to save America.\"\n\nBetween them, these men have gained access to federal premises and staffing systems that govern agencies including USAid, the Department of Health and Human Services, the education and energy departments, and the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services, and contain sensitive information relating to millions of Americans. Elez was, reportedly, erroneously given overwrite access to the Treasury department's payment system before it was yanked back to read-only.\n\nOf course, given that Doge has not responded to questions about what, if any, security clearance these young men have gone through, read-only is bad enough. The head of Doge, hiring in his own image, has turned to young, male software engineers with startup energy and the conviction that if you understand coding, you understand life. They've established sleeping pods in spare offices at the federal agencies they have been engaged to gut or dismantle, so that while Musk goes on X to mock federal employees for not working at weekends, his mini-mes work round the clock.\n\nThis feat would be more impressive if their online remarks and bios didn't flag what might diplomatically be called large gaps in their skill-sets. Musk, a man with the emotional maturity of a cartoon bank robber, is leading a group of men most of whom have no government or management experience whatsoever, let alone expertise in fields governed by the agencies they have been tasked to reform. The whole scene is reminiscent of the 90s boom in management consultancy, during which new graduates stared with frank disbelief at anyone who was over 35 and still breathing. And sure enough, as reported in the New York Times, young engineers have been overheard referring to federal employees as \"dinosaurs,\" who have in turn called the guys in baseball caps \"Muskrats.\"\n\nOn X, meanwhile, Musk amplified a post pitching \"autistic tech bros\" against \"non-binary Deep State theater kids,\" and another that said what's happening in the US right now is equivalent to \"the yearbook committe and theater kid types getting rocked by a football team and chess club alliance.\" Theatre kids and chess nerds are, traditionally, both categories of social death in high school that are targeted by queen bees and jocks, a case of Musk siding with the oppressor that's even sadder when you consider that Trump isn't even a real jock. (For a full account of Trump's hilariously mediocre sports career relative to his claims about it, read Lucky Loser by Russ Buettner and Susanne Craig.)\n\nAnyway, we know how this ends. In the largest sense, with the cancellation of programmes mandated democratically in Congress by a bunch of unelected goons in puffer vests. And in the smallest sense, with one of these 22-year-old jerks spilling his Big Gulp cup of Mountain Dew over a keyboard at the Treasury and wiping the social security data of 70 million Americans. I look forward to watching as Big Balls and co find new ways to tank an economy even more efficiently and irreversibly than Brexit.", "video": null, "screenshot": null, "prompt_instruction": "You are a professional English-to-Simplified Chinese translator, tasked with providing translations suitable for use in China (zh_CN).

Until it's clear they can't work. At which point, the monkey must toss again.\n\nBut this month, Trump, whose morning ablutions increasingly appear to consist of dousing himself in sachets of the kind of cheap hot chocolate powder I steal from three-star hotels, like a flightless bird stuck in the machine that glazes Magnum lollies, declared he wanted to build his hotels on the mass graves of Gaza. Hasn't Trump seen The Shining? It won't end well. Pity those whose children have the misfortune to die next to a monetisable stretch of shoreline. And hope humanity's next wave of mass killings happens somewhere uneven and way inland that hopefully wouldn't even make a decent golf course.\n\nIs Ukraine the frontier upon which the future of European democracy hinges, or is it just a massive stretch of undeveloped fairway, its leisure/conference utility value currently compromised only by the desire of some losers to continue living in the country they consider home? Where we see the falling domino chain that starts with Poland and ends in your back garden, does Trump see only a succession of 18-hole courses full of men in caps and enormous flapping flares brokering manly deals at the tee? Drive your golf carts over the bones of the dead!\n\nBut maybe Trump's horrible mouth-cack is just continuing evidence of his former acolyte Steve Bannon's advice to \"flood the zone with shit\"? Does Trump really hate all sea creatures so much that he has to reinstate the plastic straws Joe Biden successfully, and commendably, outlawed? Perhaps he was once told to keep his hands to himself by a mermaid. \"These things don't work,\" Trump said of paper straws. \"I've had them many times, and on occasion, they break, they explode.\" Must millions of seabirds, turtles, manatees and dolphins die because Trump imagines that paper straws explode? Or so he can suck up his Diet Coke fast enough to amuse Elon Musk, Pete Hegseth and JD Vance by burping a smelly chorus of YMCA in Biden's face next time there's a gathering of ex-presidents.\n\nLike some kind of infantilised diaper king, Trump has genuinely had a special Diet Coke-summoning button installed in the Oval Office\n\nBecause Trump, a fully grown man with unlimited funds, loves Diet Coke, and it's tempting to wonder how many of his seemingly incomprehensible policy decisions can be traced back to his desire to be continually saturated by the soft drink. Maybe there is a subterranean lake of the stuff somewhere deep beneath the Greenland tundra that the climate crisis, which doesn't exist, will soon make accessible to Trump's deep Diet Coke drills? Delighted Inuit strip off their sealskins and dance in the showering liquid as they realise they have just struck a rich seam of their new master's black gold. Like some kind of infantilised diaper king, Trump has genuinely had a special Diet Coke-summoning button installed in the Oval Office. Hopefully, he won't get it mixed up with that other button. It will be a shame if all life on Earth is fatally irradiated just because Trump wanted a 500ml bucket of fizz to swill down his Big Mac and fries.\n\nBut are we meant to take Trump's erratic announcements seriously? While the last concerned voices of the dying liberal press pen outraged articles to their dying liberal readers about Gaza hotels, the invasion of Canada and Trump making it compulsory to drink everything through a Trump Plastic Freedom Straw Company Deluxe Plastic Freedom Straw ™ ®, even cauliflower cheese soup, his homunculus Musk has been quietly dismantling the infrastructure of American government as you knew it. There are cup-and-ball tricksters on Parisian street corners with more subtle moves.\n\nHalf a dozen of Musk's own hand-harvested incels-in-waiting, the kind of people who under normal circumstances would have got rich by inventing a way in which hardcore digital pornography could have been mainlined directly into the bloodstream in liquid form, have, under the spurious authority of Musk's imaginary \"department of government efficiency,\" gone in and stolen all the data about everyone and everything in the US ever. Never mind. I am sure they will use it responsibly. What can possibly go wrong?\n\nSome people gathered at the scenes of Musk's cost-cutting exercises and waved placards. Others sat and gawked at news footage of Kanye West's naked wife's arse or enjoyed disappointing trailers for the new Captain America movie, while the world as they knew it crumbled beneath their king-sized sofas. Keir Starmer backed away, as one might from a neighbour's unpredictable weapon dog, avoiding direct comment, dodging a commitment to the AI declaration like a coward and hoping for the best, while Trumpy growls and foams. Which simply won't do.\n\nLook. I'm as disappointed as the next metropolitan liberal elitist champagne socialist by Starmer's government. While I accept, for example, the migration crisis must be addressed, I didn't expect Starmer, who once left his \"village and went to the city of Leeds\" and \"discovered a whole new world of indie bands - like Orange Juice and the Wedding Present,\" to do it with Nigel Farage-style performative cruelty. Address the migration crisis, by all means, but don't be a c*** about it. Did Orange Juice suffer the indignity of their eponymous third album not even entering the top 50 in 1984 just so, 41 years later, Starmer could send Yvette Cooper out to downgrade the desperate, like Paul Golding in heels.\n\nCurrently, as Putin puffs up under Trump's protection and unregulated AI threatens to rewrite history in real time, Starmer is on his knees sucking the paper straw of Trump's presidency.

In her latest venture, Meghan, who occupies the tricky position of having a large platform and not enough to fill it (see also: Brooklyn Beckham), launched a new lifestyle brand that, she promised in a short video, would be \"beautifully weaving together everything I cherish - food, gardening, entertaining, thoughtful living and finding joy in the everyday.\" The brand American Riviera Orchard is dead. Long live the new brand, As Ever.\n\nThe duchess and her husband, Prince Harry, have to do something and good luck to them, but it's hard not to study the rollout of As Ever for signs of the widening gap between Meghan's self-image and how the rest of the world sees her. \"\"As ever,\"\" writes the duchess on Instagram, \"means \"as it's always been\" or some even say \"in the same way as always,\"\" the \"some\" in this sentence apparently referring to the dictionary definition of a two-word phrase that no one has ever had trouble understanding.\n\nIt's ridiculous, of course, as is the hello-little-people tone adopted by the former royal highness, in keeping with the general attitude of the famous towards the unfamous - namely, one of stating the bleeding obvious as though sharing the key to existence. Still, I find myself sympathising with Meghan, who in her Instagram post and its accompanying video faces the stark challenge of having to pad out thin material. \"This is what I do,\" she says to camera, \"and I haven't been able to share it with you for the past few years, but now I can.\" What is the \"it\" here, and what has stopped her from sharing it? (It may involve jam, as did her previous brand, which she launched by sending \"limited edition\" jars of preserve to, among others, Kris Jenner, Mindy Kaling and Tracee Ellis Ross, who apparently also got a fresh bag of lemons.) Anyway, whatever the content, she hints darkly at some \"whispers\" abroad that forced her to jump the gun and share news of As Ever before she was ready - because \"I wanted you to hear it from me first.\"\n\nThe fact there is no story here makes Meghan's insistence that she is getting in front of the story all the more enjoyable, but the more curious aspect of the announcement is the \"you\" to whom she refers and the idea she clearly has of her audience. The celebrity lifestyle space is crowded, ferocious and notoriously fickle, littered with the carcasses of former brand leaders such as Chrissy Teigen. Target and Bloomingdales distanced themselves from the star around the same time as she was accused of, and later apologised for, cyberbullying a woman called Courtney. The space is also dominated by market leaders such as Gwyneth Paltrow and Rachel Zoe.\n\nMeghan is a minnow in these waters, but of course has her own secret weapon she isn't shy about using. In the new video, she deploys good old Harry to hold up the cameraphone and drop a few posh tones - \"Is this thing on?\" - to remind us that, even if As Ever isn't royal, exactly, it is at least royal adjacent. The new name is clearly a reach for something classier and more timeless than its predecessor, American Riviera Orchard, which sounded like a range of scented gift baskets you'd find at a discount shopping outlet, or the pair's charity arm, Archewell, a play on their son's name. Both brands have an aspirant lower middle-class vibe about them, which it would be rude to point out were it not for the fact that Harry and Meghan trade on class as part of their branding.\n\nWhat they are selling isn't poshness itself, which strictly speaking should entail low-comfort, hole-in-the-elbows, bad cooking and draughty houses, but - much like Trump and his performance of \"billionaire\" - a kind of ersatz poshness they imagine might appeal to the peasants. It's a hard one to get right and, with the new brand name, Meghan seems to have changed course in the direction of, say, a Calvin Klein perfume or something a bit more abstract and upmarket. Although for my money she was on to more of a winner with the obscure and personalised brand name The Tig, her first attempt at lifestyle content that had to be shelved when she started dating Harry. As she explained at the time, The Tig was derived from an abbreviation of her favourite wine, tignanello, and had about it the confidence of something genuinely felt rather than a brand name that has been kicked through a comms team.\n\nWhich brings us to the duchess's understanding of audience. Discounting the forfeiture of sympathy that comes with money and privilege, there is something akin to pathos in the video that I find painful to watch. Meghan's aw-shucks, I-know-you-love-me tone assumes not only goodwill but abject fandom on the part of an audience which, I suspect, is at least 50% made up of those who regard her not only critically but with downright derision. It is hard to witness. \"Sending lots of love,\" she signs off with noblesse oblige and an almost charming dedication to what she imagines we think of her.", "video": null, "screenshot": null, "prompt_instruction": "You are a professional English-to-Simplified Chinese translator, tasked with providing translations suitable for use in China (zh_CN).

When will wrinkles, bad teeth and big pores be back in fashion?\nTotally neutral question, no right or wrong answer: how do you feel about salmon sperm?\n\nIt's not a Nordic culinary microtrend or a sex thing, but a beauty treatment, in which \"Polydeoxyribonucleotides (PDRN) derived from purified fragments of DNA extracted from yes, \"salmon sperm\"\" are injected into your face. It does seem to work: proper research has found PDRN has wound-repairing properties in hard-to-treat contexts such as diabetic ulcers and deep burns. Good news (unless you're a male salmon). But what is it doing in healthy faces?\n\nI learned about salmon sperm in a Sunday Times article on the \"skincare secrets\" of \"26 tastemakers,\" which I read, increasingly aghast. It was a litany of lasers, microneedling, injectables and proprietary treatments with silly names that left me shouting crossly at my laptop: \"But what does it do?\" The only treatment I related to at all was Marina Abramović recounting how a friend of her mother's put hot mashed potato on her face to temporarily erase wrinkles; Abramović herself uses \"thermage radiofrequency.\" No wonder a salmon sperm practitioner says it's \"an exciting time in the aesthetic industry.\"\n\nSome contributors were celebs, regularly running the unforgiving gauntlet of high-definition television, and the rest were at least very interested, if not professionally involved, in beauty, so they probably aren't typical. And there's a certain honesty to it, at least. No one is making out their dewy glow is \"just good genes\" and \"loads of water.\" But I also think this newfound willingness to talk about \"tweakments\" (a jaunty portmanteau that makes me queasy) is a product of them being absolutely everywhere.\n\nBecause they are everywhere, for everyone. According to researchers at University College London, the UK injectables market will be worth £11.7bn by next year, with Botox and fillers available anywhere from Harley Street to high-street hairdressers. Writing in Grazia last week, the Guardian beauty columnist Sali Hughes described how \"women in teaching, policing and the civil service\" ask her advice on where to get \"good injections.\" In the US, Botox use by 20- to 29-year-olds has increased 28% since 2010, with gen Z buying into \"prejuvenation\" (another awful portmanteau), fuelled by the poreless perfection offered by filters, staring at themselves on pandemic screens and social media skinfluencers (argh).\n\nI shouldn't be surprised - actual children are buying expensive anti-ageing potions and fretting about their nonexistent crow's feet now. But still, this dramatic normalisation of invasive beauty procedures is unnerving.\n\nFor one thing, tweakments are so expensive! It's none of my business how people spend their money - my disposable income is dedicated to becoming the Joe Exotic of decorative poultry - but will we end up with an attractiveness inequality gap? Or will the democratisation of HD face mean almost everyone will be smoothly immobile soon? I suspect there will always be better and worse tweakments: that UCL research also points out how alarmingly unregulated the industry is.\n\nIt's also uncomfortable feeling so out of step. My only foray into tweakment territory is getting my brows, lost to alopecia, tattooed back on (which demonstrates how central frowning is to my character, so Botox is out). It's not that I'm smugly delighted with my 50-year-old face: the baleful crone in my new passport photo appears, inexplicably, to have a single black eye (actually just a dark circle), adding to the \"pensioner arrested after brawl outside bookies\" vibe. It would be nice to feel better about my neck, but not nice enough to actually do anything painful and expensive about it.\n\nI suppose we tweakment holdouts will have to wait, and hope, for the tide to turn. As Ozempic and shiny veneers may make thinness and Hollywood teeth look boring and basic, perhaps perfect faces will fall from fashion? I mention the veneers, because when I was watching the Bridget Jones movie, I become fascinated by Chiwetel Ejiofor's teeth. They're absolutely lovely, yes, but sort of ... normal? One lower one peeps out from slightly behind the others. It only added to his charm. Hugh Grant's 64-year-old face looked charismatically crumpled too. Maybe when everyone has been homogenised to a glazed sheen of perfection, sagging, bumps, gaping pores and rough patches will be the height of desirability. At that point, I'll be ready for my closeup.", "video": null, "screenshot": null, "prompt_instruction": "You are a professional English-to-Simplified Chinese translator, tasked with providing translations suitable for use in China (zh_CN).

Because now the foolish wokerati have been schooled beyond Johnson's wettest dreams. It's the Trump-Putin-bin Salman party! An adjudicated sex offender and convicted fraudster, and a man who sanctioned a chemical warfare hit, killing a British citizen on British soil, have met at the luxury Saudia Arabian hotel of another man, who, according to the US, reportedly approved the murder and subsequent dismemberment of a journalist, to discuss the similarly brutal dismemberment of Ukraine, without consulting either Ukraine itself or the countries most directly affected by the legitimisation of Putin's territorial anxieties. Don't worry, Poland! Stable genius Trump has got this covered, so break out the bone saws, pop the cork on the novichok and grab the girls by the pussy! There are 1970s Italian slasher films with less gruesome plotlines. Well said, Boris Johnson! That's certainly stuck it to the wokerati!\n\nIf only Johnson, and Trump's other cheerleaders in the rightwing press and on the right of the house, could be brave enough to call out Trump for what he is. If only Johnson had the moral courage of Ed Davey from the Liberal Democrats. In what newly warped reality does that sentence even exist? But, on balance, the whitewashing of the deaths of tens of thousands of Ukrainians is a small price to pay for the delight Trump has bought to the smiling faces of people who hate the transgender community, wild swimming enthusiasts and Guardian readers. Sniffing mineral rights in the air, like the smell of napalm in the morning, Trump has grabbed Ukraine by the pussy and he ain't gonna let go. Trump is, unequivocally, the worst thing to happen to human civilisation since Hitler. And Ricky Gervais's After Life.\n\nEuropean politicians more rational and less self-serving than Johnson are trying to formulate the correct response to Trump's rapid and reckless redrawing of the postwar world disorder in his own, and Russia's, interests. The correct response is to shit your pants. On Tuesday, Trump even blamed Ukraine itself for being invaded, which is a bit like blaming E Jean Carroll herself for being sexually abused in a department store changing room. Couldn't she have cut a pre-emptive deal before things escalated? Victims! Always blaming someone else. But Trump has put the idea that the invasion of Ukraine is Ukraine's fault out there now, on the world stage, amplified by his collaborators in the tech bro media, and it will gradually calcify into one of those persistent alternative facts. By Wednesday he'd called Zelenskyy a dictator (and a mediocre comedian, which in my opinion is even worse).\n\nThink what Hitler could have achieved if he'd had Twitter, currently X, and Google at his disposal\n\nAnd it's that kind of reshaping of reality that needs a coherent European response. Recently, the US vice-president, JD Vance, who has the exact same face-beard as the main male oppressor in the TV adaptation of The Handmaid's Tale, came and told the Munich security conference that Scotland had made it illegal to pray silently in your own home. Many things are illegal in Scotland. Fruit, for example, and cushions, which are deemed too soft by the Scottish Cushion Committee. But not silent private prayer. Largely ignoring dead-in-the-water Ukraine, Vance also told Europe we had some kind of moral duty to allow unchecked, factually inaccurate bullshit to clog our infosphere via Trump's tech bro acolytes\" social media platforms, his inflammatory comments about illegal Scottish prayer in the same speech proving exactly why such regulation is required. And I think he knows this.\n\nPredictably, Vancewas one of the three main early investors in Rumble, the social media site for all the people whose conspiratorial untruths and borderline criminality make them too toxic for other social media sites - Russell Brand, Alex Jones and Darth Vader etc - so he personally stood to profit from this sort of popularisation of inflammatory actionable crap. As did fellow Rumble original main investor Peter Thiel, the man behind Palantir, the big tech company Wriggling Wes Streeting is keen to hand all our NHS data to, revealing an interlocking and endless web of bad influence that only \"cat woman\" Carole Cadwalladr had the persistence of vision to apprehend, and she's currently shunting off to a subscription Substack site, a crowdfunded Cassandra in an era busy eating its own brainstem.\n\nFor a brief period around teatime on Monday, Keir Starmer, who once left his \"village and went to the city of Leeds\" and \"discovered a whole new world of indie bands - like Orange Juice and the Wedding Present\" delusionally imagined he could be some kind of go-between twixt observable reality and Trump. But did West Yorkshire jangle-pop pioneers the Wedding Present radically retool their signature sound for 1991\"s Seamonsters album just so Starmer could become a Neville Chamberlain for the cover-mounted fanzine flexidisc generation?\n\nWe have staved off outright fascism throughout most of Europe pretty well for 80 years now, but outright fascism in Europe was never quite so well funded and promoted as it is now, since the US government and the social media platforms that do its bidding decided backing outright fascism was a good way to smash the EU. Think what Hitler could have achieved if he'd had Twitter, currently X, and Google at his disposal. He wouldn't have needed the V2 rocket, Lord Haw-Haw and Hugo Boss. He could have razed half of Europe with a Hulk Hogan meme, some persuasive online misinformation and a dozen jauntily askew baseball caps.", "video": null, "screenshot": null, "prompt_instruction": "You are a professional English-to-Simplified Chinese translator, tasked with providing translations suitable for use in China (zh_CN).

We talked to Norman Eisen of Democracy Defenders Action, who is litigating against Trump, about how successful the legal resistance has been thus far, whether Trump and his allies will defy the courts, and what would happen if they did.

I certainly understand the impulse to passionately re-engage such a work, but if the definition of a masterwork is something peerless at what it sought to accomplish, how do you remake it without simply reiterating it? There's a reason no one has tried second versions of Fellini's \"8½\" or Coppola's \"The Godfather\" or Polanski's \"Chinatown.\" In the case of Fellini's achievement, is someone going to produce a more harrowing portrait of the self-deluding toxicity of male narcissism? In the case of Coppola's, of the corrosive effects of power? Or in the case of Polanski's, of the Hey-nothing-personal malevolence of late-model capitalism? (Water itself in that movie turns out to be the commodity that's manipulated for profit.)\n\nWhen it comes to those who have waded into that kind of deep water, some have tried the Let's-really-shake-things-up solution. There's the lamentable 1962 remake of \"The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari,\" for instance, which not only eliminated the central figure of Cesare the somnambulist but also featured a Caligari who instead of practicing diabolic hypnotism spent his time showing the heroine offensive pictures. Other filmmakers have chosen the even more baffling route of changing almost nothing, such as Gus Van Sant's nearly shot-for-shot 1998 remake of \"Psycho.\" The number of disappointed moviegoers you risk in remaking a masterpiece from 1922 is smaller, for obvious reasons, but even so, the director Robert Eggers has made clear in any number of interviews his understanding that his new \"Nosferatu\" is re-engaging one of the greatest of the silent movies. (In 2016, when he was first attempting to remake the film, he told an interviewer that it felt \"ugly and blasphemous and egomaniacal and disgusting\" to take up that project so early into his career.)\n\nF. W. Murnau's \"Nosferatu: A Symphony of Horror\" is itself a remake - an unauthorized adaptation of \"Dracula,\" Bram Stoker's compulsively readable fever dream of a novel - and Murnau and the screenwriter Henrik Galeen retained much of what was arresting about the original while slipping in their own major changes: They're responsible, for example, for the now-set-in-stone tradition that sunlight can destroy the vampire, a notion nowhere in Stoker's book. I likely saw \"Nosferatu\" at too impressionable an age. I was 6, PBS was showing such things and my babysitter was simply glad I wasn't burning down the house. But I would have been flattened by it whenever I saw it. It was like having felt a draft from a grave. (Its effects were so long-lasting that 30-something years later I published a novel inspired by the film and its production.) The whole thing wasn't so much petrifying as insidiously unsettling, and all of that started with the figure of Nosferatu himself. Max Schreck's performance is, 102 years later, still the benchmark for sinister and dignified repulsiveness. Schreck's vampire has the stillness of a figure in a bad dream or a spider on its web, and the world he inhabits is at times equally disconcerting. After our hero Hutter's first frightening night in Nosferatu's castle, he notices in the mirror that something has bitten his neck, and he smiles.\n\nBut the most destabilizing figure might well be Hutter's wife, Ellen, our heroine, who's again and again shown to be telepathically on the monster's wavelength, even when he's thousands of miles away, so that polarities like good and evil or desire and repulsion seem to just evaporate while we watch. That last aspect alone would seem to land this story in Robert Eggers's wheelhouse. Part of the subversive energy of movies like \"The Witch,\" \"The Lighthouse\" and \"The Northman\" derives from what feels like modern takes on historical characters in thrall to dark passions so that the distantly historical is both granted its strangeness and animated by a scrutinizing modern sensibility. At its best, his version both evokes and reconceives Murnau's most brilliant visual ideas. Murnau's masterful use of the opacities of dark archways from which the vampire can emerge and into which he can dissolve is both echoed and made new. Murnau's famously arresting use of shadows to visualize the vampire's defiling reach is reimagined when those shadows in this new version extend themselves in a 360-degree pan that evokes their vertiginous inescapability. And the shadow of the vampire's hand now extends across the entire city, repurposing the most memorable image from Murnau's \"Faust.\"", "video": null, "screenshot": null, "prompt_instruction": "You are a professional English-to-Simplified Chinese translator, tasked with providing translations suitable for use in China (zh_CN).

It was no different at the 2025 N.F.L. Honors earlier this month. Everything about the red-carpet photos accentuates their Evel Knievel-size age gap: Belichick looks sedately pleased in a maroon blazer, like a car dealer at a Shriners banquet; Hudson beams in a sparkly Cirque du Soleil-style number that covers approximately 12 percent of her torso. That's what most people seemed to notice about the pictures.\n\nBut not Dave Portnoy. The founder and owner of Barstool Sports - the Utne Reader for the light-domestic-swilling, backslapping, Zyn-packing, parlay-chasing American male - Portnoy has long been treated as an avatar for everything that elite media is not. Barstool might be considered the outermost ring of the so-called manosphere, the vast realm of male-oriented alternative media that has been credited with the rightward drift of the young male vote. Portnoy - a Trump supporter with a long history of misogynistic comments and bullying, who has been accused of nonconsensually filming women during uncomfortably rough sex - doesn't exactly run away from that label. (He has denied the claims about sexual misconduct and filed a suit against the outlet that published them; it was dismissed.) And what he noticed about the photos of Belichick and Hudson was the clutch Hudson wore, which was shaped like a little football: \"Very cool purse from BB's girlfriend,\" he posted on X. \"Football girlfriend purse.\"\n\nIt's certainly possible that Portnoy, a die-hard Patriots fan, was being ironic, conveying something like, \"I refuse to see anything unusual here.\" But I would bet that he genuinely did like the purse. I would make that bet because I have spent many hours watching Portnoy's most fascinating nonsports media product, his \"One Bite\" pizza reviews, and I know about his softer side. He has been doing these reviews for 12 years, though I first encountered them during the pandemic. I was, at that point, ambiently aware of Portnoy, but only for all the stuff people hated about his website: the \"Smokeshow of the Day\" photos, the army of online \"Stoolies\" who mobbed his many critics. But if you watch the pizza videos, you're reminded that most of the stuff these controversial media figures do is entirely normal. A lot of the time, it's downright amusing.\n\nEach episode of \"One Bite\" begins with Portnoy's walking out the door of the business under consideration, then executing the entirety of his review right out front, sometimes practically blocking foot traffic, often with the proprietor looking on anxiously. Given all this, the concept seems almost cruel: He buys an entire pie but reviews the pizza based on one bite. \"One bite,\" goes the motto. \"Everybody knows the rules.\" The reason for this, Portnoy explained in an early video, is that the response has to be immediate, beneath the level of consciousness, like a \"Rotchbloch\" test. But Portnoy can never limit himself to one bite, typically finishing about half a slice of molten pizza, blowing big cheekfuls of air on it the way you would for a toddler, balancing the rest of the pie in his other hand as he tries to sort out where it belongs on his 10-point scale.", "video": null, "screenshot": null, "prompt_instruction": "You are a professional English-to-Simplified Chinese translator, tasked with providing translations suitable for use in China (zh_CN).

It's life-and-death shit. And everyone not in the U.S. right now should consider the U.S. a motherfucking quarantine zone. That is the safest thing you can possibly do as pertains to the United States of America.\n\nOne thing I will tell you with absolute certainty is that any professional Democrat who still drags out the dead horse \"I still believe in the fundamental goodness of the American people\" is either criminally stupid or painfully deluded and you need to do ANYthing OTHER than shit that person prescribes. That theory underwent its most comprehensive test last fall and turns out it was just a glib fucking bromide that vomited blood and died.\n\nYou can believe in the fundamental goodness of SOME American people, of course, do, have at it, but as to the THE American people being \"good,\" yeah, the data pretty fucking categorically refute that.", "video": null, "screenshot": "assets/en/social/114157282362077575-anon", "prompt_instruction": "You are a professional English-to-Simplified Chinese translator, tasked with providing translations suitable for use in China (zh_CN).

So it goes. It's previously been converted for a wheelchair ramp, which means the floor has been lowered, and this means there's nowhere safe to bolt rear passenger seats, and so can't have that \"rock and roll\" bed, that converts into seatbelted seats for passengers.\nIt does add a large underfloor storage area though.\nI thought it would be fairly easy to remove the metal plates over the windows, but that turned out to be a mistaken assumption too. Was no metal plates. They'd just painted over the glass with some metallic paint. Luckily this can be just scraped off, presumably with some paint dissolving solvents applied too. Dunno. I let the professionals handle that.\n\nThe folks that can do an actually good job of converting it into a microcamper are busy till July, so I get to play at doing a half arsed job to tide it over until then.\nFirst job is taking out the floor to gain access to that underfloor area and to cover that in linoleum. Had some lying around after they did the bathroom last year.\nThen to refit the floor and cover all that in a red felt carpet.\nThe job is shoddy here really. What's needed is to insulate the entire body of the car and then cover professionally and well, but I dunno how to do all that. I just used spray glue to fasten this stretch carpet to the existing wood, that'll be replaced when it's converted proper anyway.\nThe roof will remain cold and metal till then.\n\nThis chair works very well in the van. Should ideally be fastened better to the floor, but it has a nice three mode positions.\nSeating, and chaise-long, and flat as a bed with the passenger seat folded down.\n\nYou can get a folding leaf table, and if you saw off the bottom 15cm or so of the panels forming the sides and front of the table, and also don't bother to attach any of the the back leaf, then it becomes just the right height to mostly fit under the rear window.\nIt's a little higher than the camper-fridge, but the camper fridge is pretty much the same height as a little bedside cabinet.\nThere's also a small rectangular sink that fits nicely around the same width as the fridge alongside that cut down table.\nAnd thus, the interior can be mostly constructed in my flat. The kids in the flat upstairs kept waving as me as I was doing a terrible job of cutting down those panels with a jigsaw in the yard.\n\nThen there's a whole day of carrying those things out to the van and trying to screw them into the floor.\nHad to swap the fridge and the cabinet around from the plan. The fridge is less deep than it is wide and doesn't block the table-leaf when it's at the edge with door facing the front of the car.\nI expected to have to pause here and measure up and buy some wood, but someone had thrown out a desk that matches very well and a bit more sawing managed to get that into the right shape to build a frame to hold everything in place.\nThat sink is attached by only one of the six grips that are supposed to hold it. Two can't be used flat against a wooden board, and 3 aren't against anything at all right now.\nMaybe I can get to attach better when the pump and tap arrive.\n\nI like the easy access to battery and water and things from the back. Fair amount of storage there too which is accessible from inside if the table is up.\nStill need to put the water pump into the water cannister, and power it, and attach some sort of tap to it.\n\nAnd that's about as good a job as I can do really. Hopefully some of it will still be useable in a few months when it's done properly by a professional.\nAt least the fridge ought to carry over.\nThe bed folding down past the passenger seat is great. I'm too talk for this van really, but that makes it workable. Shame the seat/bed has to be so narrow though. The two-seater was very temping and feels like it ought to just about fit but, wouldn't really be any way to unfold it from within the van and the steering wheel gets in the way for folding the driving seat down like the passenger seat does so couldn't really go flat without also lifting up.\n\nThank goodness for Blender! Not sure I could have planned all that and had any hope of it all working out if I couldn't do it in virtual 3d first.\n3 frames to show the 3 main configurations.

Oriel Oxford (530 students) vs Durham (20,000), and Oriel won, which surprised me after some mistakes they made. The captain didn't know Wittengstein's name!? Possibly just nerves. Durham was ahead, then it was tied at 170, then they dropped to 165. A pity. I was rooting for them. Great team, with all four strong, so I hope they make the cut.\n\nGame 10 of #UniversityChallenge had a great performance by Christ's Cambridge, who have a consultative captain, a good team, and a strong member named Bethlehem, so Roger Tilling called out \"Christ's Bethlehem!\" Exeter Oxford never got hold of much, and are out of the running. I could see Christ's Cambridge quietly going far in this series. \nSome nice math questions, a picture round connected to food, and a tricky flag question. Good game.\n\nGame 11 of #UniversityChallenge was St Andrews (granted university status by an antipope!) vs Cardiff. First round is nearing its end. Some good questions, including mentions of roll-on roll-of ferries, Agnes Martin, and Stax Records. Cardiff Tarsala will never forget her Booker T bloomer, I'm afraid. Nice quizzing from both teams, though it only really got cracking in the last few minutes.\n\nGame 12 of #UniversityChallenge was Leeds vs Edinburgh. Leeds took a long time to get going, then had a surge in the middle but couldn't keep it going. Seemed like a number of film questions this time, and I was glad to hear PEI as an answer; no flags, though it seems like they crop up every time. Edinburgh Myles is a good captain and the whole team is strong and works well together. I think they'll do well.\n\n#UniversityChallenge game 13 was a curious one, with Leicester being jokey, wasting time and never getting going, while the LSE captain would often turn to the farthest player for an answer, which was not infrequently wrong. Still, LSE cleaned up. I liked the blues bonus round, though sadly Leicester got none. Canadian mentions: WL Mackenzie King and Margaret Atwood. The best part was Roger Tilling saying \"Leicester Lister!\"\n\nGame 14 of #UniversityChallenge was top-notch stuff, solid quizzing, down to business, fast answers, good knowledge, close ending. It seems we'll see both SOAS London and St. Edmund Hall Oxford again, because the loser makes the repechage. Very close at the finish, down to \"Naples\" and \"pollen.\" An unassumingly great game.\n\nGame 15 of #UniversityChallenge is the first of two in the repechage, where the four highest-scoring losing teams try to make it through. This week was UCL and St. Andrews, in a good-natured cheery match. Very strong play from UCL, who have a solid team, and UCL Mandel was in top form. Good questions, some tough, such as requiring \"panthera\" specifically or knowing \"day\" in Russian.\n\nJust got to game 16 of #UniversityChallenge today, a week late, and it was a nail-biter! Really fast work at the end, with Durham coming from behind in the last few minutes to catch SOAS London in a tie in the final seconds. It went to a starter question that I got on the first clue (being an SF reader I knew \"slipstream\") but neither team knew. Second question and SOAS London Lambert guessed alpaca but it was llama, so Durham won. Phew, what a finish. 😰\n\nGame 17 of #UniversityChallenge is the first of eight knockout games in the second round. This was UCL and LSE, and UCL gave an outstanding performance: very fast buzzing, good teamwork, wide general knowledge from them all (UCL Mandel notable again); they took off at the start and never slowed. Very impressive.\n\nGame 18 of #UniversityChallenge was Durham vs Open University. I was rooting for Durham, who have a great team, but in the end to my surprise Open took it, after a number of rather slow answers. I was glad Durham got Marcel Duchamp right on one question; too bad no one knew Yoko Ono as a Fluxus artist. Much respect for Durham Nash, especially on bird silhouettes and flags.\n\nGame 19 of #UniversityChallenge was Exeter vs Bristol. Bristol got going at the start and never looked back, rolling with momentum, finishing with an incredible score. Exeter only clawed their way back to 0 after 17 minutes. \nI liked the question on common terms in Chinese place names, such as 北 (běi) in Beijing etc. Good geographic knowledge shown.\n\n#UniversityChallenge is back from the Christmas alumni series, and game 20 was liked greased lightening in comparison. Darwin Cambridge Whitaker tore into questions like a monster, but everyone was in good form on that team and also on Edinburgh. Momentum changed through the game. Good quizzing. Three more games in round two, then the long quarter-finals.\n\nIt's quite a change to go from the Christmas series of #UniversityChallenge, where four people didn't know the name of the narrator of Moby-Dick even when told his name is in the first sentence of the book, to the regular round, where they're racing to buzz on questions like \"Fifty-three British thermal units is to grouse hunting as Sydney, Australia, is to what famous star of the London stage?\"\n\nGame 21 of #UniversityChallenge was Wadham Oxford vs Imperial. What a game! Astounding performance from Imperial. \nHowever, being King Crimson fan, I was disappointed that no one recognized them from the opening of \"21st Century Schizoid Man,\" and dismayed when someone thought \"I Zimbra\" by Talking Heads (with Fripp on guitar) was by the Bee Gees. Can't have it all. I remain incredibly impressed.\n\nGame 22 of #UniversityChallenge was Christ's Cambridge vs St Edmund Hall Oxford, two small colleges, but that's how the rules are set up.  Nice picture round with the Dunning-Kruger effect, Asch conformity experiments, and bouba-kiki effect.  Another on mushrooms, which seemed tough to me; identifying them by eye is not easy. Solid game, good playing all around.\n\n#UniversityChallenge game 23 was Cardiff against Queen's Belfast. Ended with a lower score than I felt it would get, maybe due to missed bonuses, but the starters were buzzed fast. Nice flag knowledge, and a good picture round identifying physical laws by diagrams of experiments. A bit too much bantz for my taste, but a solid game.

Because I actually have to do some tech-related talks this month, and also with the dark side of tech being so blatant lately, I felt the need to think about it more, and explore my associations/values etc!\n\nMarch 1 - Starting with the 10 of Wands, typically representing overload, burden.\nHere it is represented by a variety of early computing projects, many subsidized by their respective governments.\nI think of how before a computer or calculator was a thing it was a job. Even after they existed, people still had to mediate, calculate, punch cards, interpret, etc. And in my own work I still often feel like a babysitter of inflexible computational quirks... why can't the spreadsheet software, or CMS, or database just do that mind-numbingly boring and burdensome stuff for me?\nI also think how, even if it's built on what were once dull analog tasks, it's not -exactly- the same though, is it? In middle school computer lab I was taught a bit of BASIC, and being able to make a simple text \"frogger\" or branching adventure program, even if they were super rudimentary, was more compelling for some reason than imagining them or drawing them in a notebook... the sort of action at a delay/distance that computing offers, or that is computing's illusion...\n\nMarch 2 - 9 of Swords... following on from the feelings of overload and burden yesterday, this card represents nightmares and anxiety about the future.\nAppropriately it's represented here by The Tavistock Institute of Human Relations, a UK governmental body established in 1946 that acted regionally, nationally, and internationally for “the social engagement of social sciences” or more bluntly, using theoretical methods to “change behavior in groups and civilian populations.”\nObviously the name Tavistock brings to mind the overbearing interference of the UK government in constantly trying to block any sort of trans care, or only dispensing it as a last resort after you’ve gone through years of waiting around and a thorough psychiatric probing. A population where everyone just conformed to the two standard cis gender roles would indeed be much easier to control, so to a “Labour” government obsessed with means testing, pathologizing and cutting benefits, it’s of course desirable to treat “normality” as a virtue and any difference as disease to eliminate.\nI could talk about so many things, the awful CBT and soft conversion therapy I’ve personally received in the UK, how state surveillance and punishment disproportionately targets autistic people, how even punitive and inadequate psychological care is too hard to access, how outcomes are measured in “productivity” rather than happiness. A tendency that is not technic in the big machines or internet enabled devices way, but has infested every aspect of life as much as people fear tiktok attention spans have; people I want to ally with constantly crowing “just be normal” or getting sucked down a health and fitness grifthole.\nAn exhausting and sad card. I’ll be honest, I almost put it back when I pulled it lol. But obviously a big part of contemporary technological thought nevertheless.\n\nMarch 3 - The Star, hope, inspiration, future goals. A much more positive card than we've had so far!\nBut it's hard to feel positive about the massively exploitative and yet still totally underwhelming reality of artifical intelligence and quantum computing hype at the moment. The idea of an omnipotent computer, that could, indeed, simulate or work at an atomic or subatomic level, has kind of been the great dream of computing for a long time. It's almost a philosopher's stone type of thing.\nYesterday I reread this great essay on the current generative AI models by Hito Steyerl (https://newleftreview.org/issues/ii140/articles/hito-steyerl-mean-images). She does a great job of going into how reliant these systems still are on human-made images, cleaned data, and ongoing human moderation at every level, but she also makes the observation that while their outputs masquerade as bits of text or images, which people wrongly attribute intention or creativity to, they're really statistical representations, with all of the inherent ideology and limitations of statistics baked in.\nWhat would a truly intelligent computer capable of expanding our analytical powers and relieving the burden of tedious labor and the risks of incomplete information look like, and under what context would it be used to reinvent life towards more autonomy and joy rather than accelerating exploitation and control? Can we hope for such a thing with IBM and DARPA still in the picture...?\n\nMarch 4 - The King of Swords, intellectual drive, clarity, calling for authoritative action. A go-for-it type of thing.\nTimothy Leary certainly was a sort of intellectually driven, though more of a “question authority” type. Likewise, looking it up, the Eight-circuit Model of Consciousness here is generally thought to have little actual scientific credibility. Still… what model of consciousness does? Despite being how all of our “information” comes to us, it’s kind of ambiguous what this thing actually is, much less if there’s any systemic patterns that determine how it works.\nI find it kind of inspiring to contemplate a multi-part model of consciousness that is both inward and outward looking. Leary was also of a period where there was optimism about space exploration, and the possibility of making contact with other species, from Earth or beyond. Now we seem to find this idea kind of embarrassing, because the idea of explaining ourselves feels embarrassing. Which in a way is it’s own kind of constantly-reinforcing self-centeredness.\nThere’s nothing more self-centered in the irritating way than how psychedelics as self-help, a “miracle” mental illness cure, the one weird trick to go 10x or come up with that sick disruptive business deal or chill out your bitch wife, have kind of become mainstream now. It’s all very inward-looking to the point that there’s nothing besides inward-ness. What’s the point of a honed mind if you can’t, like the king of swords, point it outwards?\n\nMarch 5 - Five of Pentacles... A difficult situation, struggle, financial insecurity.\nInfrastructure... precisely that thing it never feels like there's enough cash for. ESPECIALLY in tech, where it always flows towards hype and disruption rather than maintaining what already exists.\nThe Internet is so huge, has such great practical benefits, and is an important part of so many peoples' lives, that of course we want the infrastructure maintained, and there to be good governance... Maybe it was the hype of the Internet itself that allowed some of these early gestures towards standardization and productive ground rules to stick.\nThough there are a ton of tech corporations involved, a surprising amount was also done via the US Department of Defense directly, and now a lot of the corporations (ex- Don't Be Evil Google, for example) are chipping away at the principles they once helped set up... Whose infrastructure? It's always tied to governance, and always ideological. Be careful who you go asking for cash when you're broke...\n\nMarch 6 - DEATH!! An inevitable and total transformation, possibly painful, but not necessarily The End...\nA lot of anti-tech sentiment seems to wish that we could just put certain things back in the box. But the world where the technology that provides connection and access to information was entangled by its maybe well-intentioned originators with military and surveillance culture, game theory and bombs, is the world we have.\nI always found the PVP gimmick for MGSV's online mode to be weirdly inspiring... if we want to live in a world without the atomic bomb, it'll have to be one where we took them all apart with our own hands. And it'll be one where the knowledge that it was made at one time will also always be a thing. How we frame it is up to us... there is no going back.

{"dataset_id": "wmttest2025", "collection_id": "general", "doc_id": "en-zh_CN_#_social_#_114294867111841563", "domain": "social", "src_lang": "en", "tgt_lang": "zh_CN", "src_text": "Even though I've mostly transitioned to PC gaming over the past decade, my preferred peripherals are still controllers.\nI understand the advantages of KB+M play, but as someone who already uses those tools for work I find picking up a controller helps separate the two activities and gives my wrists a break. I've also been playing video games long enough to see the technology and layouts used drastically change, though some first party controllers seem to have stagnated a bit.\nI recently found a controller I really liked because it has features that have really impressed me enough to want to talk about it at length, but to do that I feel the need for some context; not a whole history lesson, just a little stroll through my collection of controllers that materialized over a lifetime of engaging in this hobby.\nBy the end I hope you'll understand why this is a topic I care so much about I'd spend all day talking about these devices.\n\nMy decision to build up a PC game collection started during the transition between the Xbox 360 and the Xbox One; I thoroughly enjoyed the 360, but the One was looking like a disaster. Since the new consoles from all three major companies held little interest and I'd been in school for Computer Information Systems, I got myself a 360 pc dongle and resolved to make the switch.\nEach of these controllers saw extensive use, and the 360 had the asymmetrical stick placement I preferred. All but two of the controllers in this picture are currently unusable either from loose/drifting sticks, faulty buttons, or failing cables/connections; both of the working ones are 3rd party Afterglows (which have their own problems).\nAs much as I loved these controllers, the official ones were the worst in terms of durability, and some were faulty from day one but Microsoft would refuse my RMA request.\nIt got worse when I tried the most expensive one.\n\nThere was a time when I fell for the myth that \"You get what you pay for\" was as true for expensive stuff as it was for cheap stuff; it's because of this controller that I know better. I got this Elite Series 2 controller despite knowing the first iteration had some serious flaws.\nThat controller lasted just under a year before the stick drift started to set in, and the right bumper only registered half of the time. The cable it came with sucks ass, never worked with any other controllers. The lag from using bluetooth was so bad the dongle was practically necessary. On top of all that, the back paddles didn't work no matter what software/drivers I used, none of my games ever read those paddles as an inputs.\nThe Raikiri Pro (was bundled with a laptop) is my current dedicated desktop controller and it works fine [for now], but I will never spend another dime on Official Xbox branded controllers. Fuck Microsoft, I hope Xbox rots!\n\nThe Nintendo Switch reignited my love for portable gaming after years of surviving out of crappy laptops. The joycons were small but versatile, and the pro controller felt really comfortable in the hands.\nI loved these controllers so much I modified them and swapped in hall-effect sticks [and metal latches] this past year, and while I'm well aware of the drift issue, mine have worked flawlessly since 2017 with no signs of wearing out. I've put just as many hours into these controllers as I did all those Xbox controllers; either I got very lucky or microsoft designs their controllers to fail faster than both of their competitors combined. Nintendo's offerings have some drawbacks, but the fact it's additional features like Gyro input have been officially supported is noteworthy.\nI hope to keep these controllers working for as long as they continue to be supported on other platforms; there are many like them, but these ones are mine.\n\nA brief note on Play Station controllers to round out the 1st party lineup: I never liked them.\nDual Shock 1-3 felt exactly the same to me with exactly the same flaws: Oversized thumbsticks placed too close together, mushy face/shoulder/trigger buttons that seemed to wear out very quickly, and a D-pad that just felt wrong. Dual Shock 4 fixed a lot of problems, but introduced a bunch of new ones. I got a Dual Sense because some friends had a hard time with asymmetrical thumbsticks, and for some reason local stores were selling them for $20 less than DS4 controllers.\nI don't really use this controller: Face buttons are spaced too far apart, my audio in/output keeps defaulting to the controller when it's connected, the bumpers are weirdly tall, and I keep accidentally pressing the track pad when trying to hit menu/share.\nThey are fine guest controllers that have come a long way in terms of design, but for me they're a novelty at best.\n\n8BitDo was my first foray into good 3rd party controllers. This original SN30 Pro (later versions have hall-effect sticks and do not come in the SNES colour scheme) remains one of my favourites because holding it is reminiscent of my first console, the SNES.\nIf I'm having a crappy day and need a nostalgic escape, this is the first controller I reach for. It has all the functionality of a Switch Pro controller, but compacted into a modernized rendition of the SNES controller, complete with concave X/Y + convex A/B buttons, and possibly the best D-pad I've ever used. It's got some minor problems, but it's been a constant source of comfort.\nOne day the sticks will fail, or the battery will discharge for the last time; but if it means getting one of the modern versions (with hall-effect sticks) and shell-swapping them, I'll do it when the time comes.\nWith such a connection, surely 8BitDo can't do better than this, right? Well...\n\nWhen I want the familiar comforts of the SN30 Pro but with all the features of a modern controller, the 8BitDo Pro 2 has been my multi-platform controller of choice.\nEverything about this is a functional upgrade from the SN30 Pro: more comfortable grips, hall-effect sticks, analog triggers, programmable back paddles, a physical X/D/S/A mode toggle switch, and a [somewhat] easily replaceable battery with the option of using AAs in a pinch. I also sprung for the carrying case and the mobile phone holster, which doesn't see as much use with a phone (I don't trust its grip that much), but for more compact retro emulation handhelds, it can expand the list of playable games to include ones that need precise analog controls.\nThere's very few negatives I can say about this controller, but it sits at a close 3rd for favourite controller of my collection. I'll talk about my number 2 pick in a moment, but before that I need to talk about...\n\nHow hard is it to find a modernized N64 controller?\nThere are plenty of cheap N64 imitation controllers, but the three-pronged original was an objectively bad design. I could play N64 games with a modern controller using clever configuration to make the face buttons function as C-buttons, but it's not the same for so many reasons.\nI got the RetroFighters Brawler 64 to solve this anachronistic conundrum, and it's gone above and beyond my expectations. It was made to mimic the official NSO N64 controller down to the Switch recognizing it as one, with a toggle to make it register as a Pro controller sans right-stick.\nIt has some problems, but between its layout and compatibility it solves way more problems the official version has. It's perfect for showing someone N64 emulation without the intimidation of the original or the anachronism from finagling a modern controller to work the same.\nIt's very good at what it's trying to do.\n\nI got this steam controller from a pawn shop after negotiating the price down shortly after the fire sale came to an end on steam. It needed some TLC, and I did what I could to get it up and running again.\nIt remains one of the most customizable controllers in my collection, with a unique [if questionable] design and features ahead of it's time (gyro aim, back paddles, haptic feedback, etc). It has some problems though; It requires AAs, uses Micro-USB for wired connections, occasionally turns itself back on after being turned off, the back paddles are stiff enough to cause fatigue, the thumbstick cap is necessary since the rubber on it is deteriorating, and it's functionality tends to fluctuate with every update to steam input.\nIt's more of a unique historical artifact than a regularly used input, but it's a welcome addition and fun to tinker with on rainy days.\nIt also isn't my number 2 pick, that honour goes to the fact that...\n\nThe 8BitDo Ultimate Bluetooth controller is an almost perfect controller.\nHall-effect sticks, included charging dock that doubles as a port for the included dongle, dedicated 2.4ghz/bluetooth toggle switch, NS Pro layout with a much improved D-pad, analog triggers, and programmable back paddles. When I sit down on a couch with this controller, I can swap between a Steam Deck and a Switch faster than the time it takes the TV to switch inputs.\nIt does have some drawbacks though: It only does X/Switch signals (no android or apple modes), the triggers are uncomfortable, and input lag seems to be affected by the time it took to connect to the dongle/switch.\nI thought this was the best it could get, but like my time with Xbox controllers I was operating on assumptions that started to sound like old brand loyalty reflexes coming back. What I'd hoped to upgrade it to was such a disappointment it swiftly shook me from those assumptions.", "video": null, "screenshot": "assets/en/social/114294867111841563-anon", "prompt_instruction": "You are a professional English-to-Simplified Chinese translator, tasked with providing translations suitable for use in China (zh_CN).

Indica Nightmare?\n\nits then that the immortal words of mao resonate through my loaded taco skull to go investigate instead of fantasizing about Difficult Conversation Doritos so i go and try to track down doritos late night line. 500 food products are released to the US public every year and about 480 of them disappear within 6 months and pepsico knows this which is why they don't do any marketing or advertisement - blind drops at the corner, secret boxes where the arrival IS the announcement. theres very little\n\nwhat i manage to collate is this: there are three other flavors of late night doritos: Sizzlin' Cheeseburger (?), Last Call Jalapeno Poppers (??) and \"Chili Sandwich\", which is not a flavor. however in my attempts to find out anything about the doritos late night line, i stumble upon DORITOS AFTER DARK @ THE CRYPTO.COM STADIUM, the official doritos concept restaurant. thinking that the marketing is perhaps a near-miss, i nearl yclose the tab but for spotting LATE NIGHT in copyright font.\n\nwhat i have concluded is as follows:\n- doritos after dark, which is not a chips brothel, has nearly nothing to do with doritos late night, despite both being named the same thing and having near-identical branding. i assume this is something like when your older brother gives you a shirt with his name monogrammed on the lapel\n- everybody responsible for doritos after dark is going to loaded hell\n\nwe don't necessarily need an ersatz munch squad about this - we live in america, the average manhole leads to the garden of earthly delights original mario bros movie style, so why should the lakers arena be necessarily different. it's, like, fair food, no worse than fried oreos. even so, there is something perhaps post-fierian about the ramen-rito, a burrito where the primary carbohydrate substrate is cooked ramen, and which advertises \"fresh scallions\". Uh, yeah, I sure hope it does.\n\nto dine here is to reap the wine-dark benefits of being a ticketholder at the crypto.com stadium, home of the fucking lakers - i don't know how much lakers tickets cost, but i do know that the lakers are basically the yankees of basketball, which means the price of a ticket is counted in teeth. so yes. \"Kick it up a notch.\" \"Taste a bold new act.\" wh - why is that doritos bag so *airbrushed?* it's giving adam sandler click. but i'm nitpicking here. It's your The Lakers, you choose the food.\n\nNah.\n\nyou know that picture of the guy with the shirt that says 0 fears and then bart swimpson porn is banned so it says 1 fear? It's similar to that except now i am afraid to eat the home cooking of anybody i do not know intimately because there is a slim yet extant chance that i might sit down to a delicious home cooked normals dinner to eat with them in their house and similar to judas at the famous dinner they might kiss my cheek good-like then serve me up \"COOL RANCH BISCUITS WITH HONEY BUTTER\"\n\nlike ther eis undoubtedly, because the world is so so so sosososoo big and we are so small one person per person and information is so big and free, somebody who has made this, and then served it to someone who does not have the same brain as them. homecooked food is meant to be eaten. like it's a social problem now, sitting down in your breaksfast nook, or your table, and your wifey brings in a charcuterie board, like this, and you have to eat it. or it's bad for you. like as a person.\n\nthere's a lot of things that are wrong with america. this doesn't clock the 15th percentile. it's just an average sort of excess, another straw on the like last descendant of the great plains buffalo's ailing back. even so, even being as jaded to the way that americans eat as i am, having ordered a one-scoop cup of superman flavor ice cream last night, i find that i have not and could never reach rock bottom. there is a 121st day of sodom, my uncle who works at nintendo told me about it.", "video": null, "screenshot": "assets/en/social/114300646822630777-anon", "prompt_instruction": "You are a professional English-to-Simplified Chinese translator, tasked with providing translations suitable for use in China (zh_CN).

A thread\nNote: all major updates will start with the thread emoji\nIm attempting to move to Germany and find a new life! Follow this thread to follow this journey\nThe last 32 hours or so were HORRIBLE! Panic attack, extreme fatigue, nausea.\nBut! Look at where I am! The airport!! I fucking did it!\nI pushed myself too hard and ended up not sleeping for 32 hours. As of right now (write now) I am on the 33rd hour :p. Looking back, this is the way, and it wouldnt have happened any other way. ADHD is a Tanzanian to tame. \nEDIT: tazmanian.\nI have done so much in the last 3 months! I thought it would have only taken me 1 month, but severely underestimated EVERYTHING. Rebooked the flight twice, but with 2 deadlines, this plane is it! \nGosh.. I met with realtor, packed (most) of the house, gave a 1/3 of my stuff away, the appropriate ppl have access to the rest, and my sister can be a PoA should need be. 7 or so documents apostille'd, degree recognized in Germany, language coarse booked, (potentially a scam) appartment rental reserved, vital documents ascertained! I also have a internationally certified document proving I am not a criminal! ITS GO TIME!\n\n🧵 Officially in Germany! Got my Visa, new SIM card in (Spain) and awaiting the train to Köln.\nGotta be honest. I screwed myself with bags. Too heavy for this smol trans girl 😅. Navigating where to get my luggage was fun! Turns out connections via train from plane are elsewhere. I'm usually pretty collected, but its a bit of stress Ill be honest. But only because as-it-stands right now, I have no support systems. I dont know this city. Have heavy luggages. Etc. Etc. \nI have never been more parched in my life! \nPs: I have a story from the plane that isnt appropriate for fedi. And thats saying something! (doesnt involve me) \nBooked a hotel (yea yea.. Late on that.. But i SHOULD have an appt. Tomorrow.) \nFirst impressions of Germany: architecture, even of the steel & glass of the train station, does not dissapoint! Germanic design totally didnt play any role in my choice of destinations 😝.\n\nOkay, the first German words to learn will have to be train & transit related. Future Indi, make a note!\nSeattle & San Francisco are the best public transits in America [citation needed] and once you figure it out, it really is zip zap zoom on and off and you're there! I want to get to that, but even living in Seattle it took me a few months.\n\n🧵 NOTE: Do NOT get on on the opposite end of the train when carrying 3 bags!\nI took note of the prev train and prepared to whre I thought was car 1.\nIm that bumbling American today 🚬😎\n\n🧵 A simple breakfast, but god is it good.\nI sure hope lactase enzymes are easily accessible in Deutschland, or else Im in trouble 😅. Nom nom nom 🥐\n\n🧵 I got my keys! Sweaty, hot, and went through an ordeal getting the keys from skeevy old man neighbor-building landlord who was totally hitting on me. Ugh. Sometimes it sucks being cute. \nDo i pass or something?! Or does he not care? XD\nI meet my landlord on Monday for anmeldung registration paper, mailbox name, contract (that I asked for) and the like. Ive been told having the keys bestows some tennant-rights/protections so we good. \nAppartment rental for 3-months though! Lets gooo\nEDIT: Reposted with keys erased\n\nFor those wondering, I still have my hotel room. I played it safe and didn't want to rely on being able to get keys yesterday with luggage in tow\n\n🧵 I now have a German telefonnummer! Exciting!\nThat travel sim I bought did help bridge the gap, but the service was horrendous and relied on roaming. I was also under the impression it could dial out, which it could not. I already needed to call a German number.\nThe SIM salesperson was also an expat (not american) and I had the nicest conversation! He wanted tips with learning programming*, and I asked how long to learn German and he was super inspiring! Saying that those who must learn—like for work—learn much more and faster! He encouraged me to keep with it and in 3 months I should be fine 🫶. \nI will try to keep my numver when I inevitably switch. I chose this from convenience. Being that he didnt even require me an address, only an ID to activate. \nAside: no, I didnt think D-Netz was a Deez Nuts reference... Ofc not xD. You're silly for even thinking that haha\n(*hes starting in Python! Which I think is the MOST fun, even if someone has to unlearn bad habits. I think its a valuable litmus test for those to see if programming is for them) \n\n🧵 Today's agenda:\n1. Finish professional CV (most important!)\n2. Find out how to get to private German language coarse (starts tomorrow, in-person). \n3. Trip to appartment from hotel with backpack (slowly bringing stuff over. I overencombered myself)\n4. Eat out! (food! Get ur mind out of the gutter! Lol) \nIm delaying being a tourist. I found out about the Köln-karte, a tourist 1-2 day pass that lets you do stuff. I dont nessisarily WANT to delay being a tourist... But shit has to get done. Ya know? Its different when I'm trying to establish a foothold. \nPlus it'll be good to do it in the week. Im in Köln M-Th for classes at 16:00-18:00. Meaning I could spend the best portion of the day outside ☀️💜\nKnow what didnt make the cut? What i had to nix? My fucking drawing tablet! It was an old Galaxy Book (wacam digitizer). But I really wanna draw! Thats how I want to visit Germany. Go to random place. Sketch. People watch. Sketch. Sure... Paper... But have you USED a digital canvas? Lol. Maybe Ill buy a used ipad.\n\n🧵 Time to go grocery shopping in this tiny town of 75k. Kinda nervous.\n---\nAlso I got bumped on my language course 😭. Not enough people this cycle. \nI inquired about normal attendance and they said I just so happen to get unlucky, because their A1.1 course is their most popular. But its all good! They DO have an online course that starts next week. Ill probably take that, even though I wanted to be in person for multiple reasons :p. Ill get started with my vocabulary with Anki/SRS in the meantime. LetMeTellYou I can study well 😬\n\n🧵 My first homecooked breakfast in my new home\nI made thebstrawberry compote from scratch using fresh strawberries. I had no spatula, coffee water from stove boiling. Everything is slightly harder without my wares :p\n\n🧵 A trick to ordering food in Germany:\nIf a number is called 5 times, it's your number\n\n🧵 Even the dogs here speak German! They are all wauwau insteaf of Bark Bark\n\n🧵 Omgosh free TV! I was thinking of buying a used one! And it says it works?\nCant read the rest. Must not be important.\nWell! I found out what the rest says! It says that the stand is broken and will fall down the tile stairwell making the absolute loudest sounds possible if not careful!\nNoted\n\n🧵 I swear... Every day in a new country is an absolute adventure! Nothing is easy!not even ordering coffee and treat.\nTasse cafe creme\n**gestures 1 finger up and points to pastry I dont even know what its calle din english**\nI KNEW she asked if it was for here or to go. I tried to gesture to go. But... Well.. End result is I ate in. Asked for a Kästchen on the way out. Got a bag! Alright! That one Ill count as a success.\nAnyone else's first days a whirlwind? I feel like Ive been here for weeks. No exaggeration! The midday naps in which I sleep harder than a tardigrade in a global ice age probably doesnt helo my sense of passage of time :p\n\n🧵 So I was upset to give away my Sodastream and Restaurant sized canister mod for it, because I've been big into fizzy water and making homemade healthy sodas.\nTURNS OUT Germany LOVES FIZZY WATER! You actually have to specify Flat sometimes! 😅 \nI just like it because when it's overcarbonated and you drink it and it's so intense it hurts... it feels refreshing! \n🫧🫧🫧🫧🫧🫧🫧🫧🫧🫧🫧🫧🫧🫧🫧🫧🫧🫧🫧🫧🫧🫧🫧🫧🫧🫧🫧🫧🫧🫧🫧🫧🫧🫧🫧🫧🫧🫧🫧🫧🫧🫧🫧🫧🫧🫧🫧🫧🫧🫧🫧🫧\n\n🧵 Okay... I dont want the honeymoon phase to end >_>. More great German things plz :P\nOkay. There are some downsides. All food tastes so..... how do I put it... German XD. Comically so!\nI've eaten Korean, Chinese, Taiwanese and Japanese cuisine now. And all of them have the distinct taste of.. sauerkraut?? But, it's in the rice itself. The part thats supposed to be the most neutral of flavor.\nI made Gnocci Carbonarra (white sause) and, while it was funking delicious, tasted like Brätwurst. I thought I was safe making food at home, but I'm not xD. \nNow, I've eaten authentic italian in Syracuse NY (it's an italian historic city) and been to Taiwan. So I wonder if given time my taste buds will adapt and I will think everything tastes like how I remember it. Like as if there are subtle tones I'm just not used to yet 🤔 . And hense why I THINK everything has a foreign taste to it.\nAside: Also these arn't new foods to me so Im comparing them to what I know. Versus trying... say... Ethiopian cuisine (something new)\n\n🧵 I am not officially registered in Germany! Anmeldung in-hand! Woo 🎉\nAnd I knew a lot for German than I thought in this exchange! I practiced German and she practiced English. (we both were being humble, but her English was good) \n\"Im sorry to ask... But are you man, woman, or divers?\" 💜💜\nWe proceeded to talk about that. And she said she wondered if maybe thats why I come from states and I was like: yes, its so nice to hear other people understand. Omg.\nShe said shes happy that people [like me] come and see Germany as a safe place 🫶\n\n🧵 Netflix has joined the list alongside Ebay, Amazon, and Zelle in deactivating/locking my accounts due to 'suspicious activity'. And amongst the greater list of systems putting me in what we'd call \"The Bad Flow\" at work. (The flowchart of what the worst-case scenario looks like for a probable bad-actor).\nFreenet Funk denied me 3 times, but the 4th went through. FINALLY received their sim card. Expatrio did finally accepted my totally valid proof of residence after declining it the first time (my literal proof of anmeldung, which they stated is valid...) and unlocked my account last week. And the money that went into the void? It did turn up. So not all things are perilously bad, but I am literally swimming upstream against a system hellbent on making my life as difficult as possible.\nAnd here is where I could talk about systemic oppression being literal digital systems, and how these issues wouldn't happen to someone who came over on a job transfer. But I came over the hard way, unregistered, and flagged one system which I'm sure triggered the next and the next. It all started around when I stopped doing tourist stuff :P. But ultimately my suspicious behavior is abruptly moving overseas. I was explicitly told so by the ebay personnel on the phone. (They even told me it's extremely unlikely for someone to move countries. so in ebay's case it sounds like you'd always get flagged).\nAside: A victory, buying laundry tokens from the hausmeister! I memorized a few words and shit bricks when I WhatsApp'd him and he called me immediately on the phone xD.\n\n🧵 My house was robbed.\nAlso, I'm sick again?! A relapse?\nI better get better before surgery in less than 23 days...\n\n🧵 Add Paypal to the list of accounts I got locked out of.\nAbsolutely unbelievable...\nUnfortunately, I dont know how to resolve this one. I tried calling US paypal and they wont touch German Paypal (I have 2 accounts. I'm supposed to have one account per country according to Paypal FAQ).\nBut I dont know German to navigate a fluid conversation like that of unlocking an account. And having someone help... is... this is sensitive stuff.
